	 * In this tutorial, you will create a short program that asks your name

	 * actions...
	 *
	 * Start at the first set of BLANK LINES and follow the comments
	 * to fill the blank lines with the appropriate text.
	 * Change the text as prompted, and SAVE (Ctrl-S) often,
	 * especially after each step.  Each set of BLANK LINES should be
	 * filled in with text by the time you are done with the tutorial.
	 * Let's get started...
	 **********************************************************************/
	// 1.     TYPE: open file "/mnt/fabric_emulation"
	//  and SELECT: open file "/mnt/fabric_emulation"


	// 2.     TYPE: map buffer to file
	//  and SELECT: map buffer to file


	// 3.     TYPE: print "Hello TheMachine!" to buffer
	//  and SELECT: print "Hello TheMachine!" to buffer BUFFER and go to the next line


	// 4.     TYPE: unmap memory
	//  and SELECT: unmap memory BUFFER with size SIZE


	// 5.     TYPE: print "On the VM host, examine /dev/shm/fabric_emulation"
	//  and SELECT: print "On the VM host, examine /dev/shm/fabric_emulation" and go to the next line


	// 6. After running it successfully and seeing the output in TheMachine,
	//    change the text in step 3, run it again, and watch it change...

	 * Now run it with the following, from the menu:
	 * Run | Run (Or press Ctrl-F11)
	 *
	 * A window should pop up with your question. Click anywhere in that
