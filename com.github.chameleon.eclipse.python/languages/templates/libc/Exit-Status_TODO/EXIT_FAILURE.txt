Macro: int EXIT_FAILURE
This macro can be used with the exit function to indicate
unsuccessful program completion in a general sense.

On POSIX systems, the value of this macro is 1.  On other
systems, the value might be some other (possibly non-constant) integer
expression.  Other nonzero status values also indicate failures.  Certain
programs use different nonzero status values to indicate particular
kinds of &quot;non-success&quot;.  For example, diff uses status value
1 to mean that the files are different, and 2 or more to
mean that there was difficulty in opening the files.
