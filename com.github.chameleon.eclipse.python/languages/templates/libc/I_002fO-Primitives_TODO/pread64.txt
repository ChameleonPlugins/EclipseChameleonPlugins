This function is similar to the pread function.  The difference
is that the offset parameter is of type off64_t instead of
off_t which makes it possible on 32 bit machines to address
files larger than 2^31 bytes and up to 2^63 bytes.  The
file descriptor filedes must be opened using open64 since
otherwise the large offsets possible with off64_t will lead to
errors with a descriptor in small file mode.

When the source file is compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 on a
32 bit machine this function is actually available under the name
pread and so transparently replaces the 32 bit interface.
