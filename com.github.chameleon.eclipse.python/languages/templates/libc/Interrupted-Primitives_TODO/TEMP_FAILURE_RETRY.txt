Macro: TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY (expression)
This macro evaluates expression once, and examines its value as
type long int.  If the value equals -1, that indicates a
failure and errno should be set to show what kind of failure.
If it fails and reports error code EINTR,
TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY evaluates it again, and over and over until
the result is not a temporary failure.

The value returned by TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY is whatever value
expression produced.
