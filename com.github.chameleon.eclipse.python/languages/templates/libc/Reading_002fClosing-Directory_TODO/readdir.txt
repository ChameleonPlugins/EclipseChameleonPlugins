This function reads the next entry from the directory.  It normally
returns a pointer to a structure containing information about the
file.  This structure is associated with the dirstream handle
and can be rewritten by a subsequent call.

Portability Note: On some systems readdir may not
return entries for . and .., even though these are always
valid file names in any directory.  See File Name Resolution.

If there are no more entries in the directory or an error is detected,
readdir returns a null pointer.  The following errno error
conditions are defined for this function:


EBADF
The dirstream argument is not valid.



To distinguish between an end-of-directory condition or an error, you
must set errno to zero before calling readdir.  To avoid
entering an infinite loop, you should stop reading from the directory
after the first error.

In POSIX.1-2008, readdir is not thread-safe.  In the GNU C Library
implementation, it is safe to call readdir concurrently on
different dirstreams, but multiple threads accessing the same
dirstream result in undefined behavior.  readdir_r is a
fully thread-safe alternative, but suffers from poor portability (see
below).  It is recommended that you use readdir, with external
locking if multiple threads access the same dirstream.
