The backtrace_symbols_fd function performs the same translation
as the function backtrace_symbols function.  Instead of returning
the strings to the caller, it writes the strings to the file descriptor
fd, one per line.  It does not use the malloc function, and
can therefore be used in situations where that function might fail.
