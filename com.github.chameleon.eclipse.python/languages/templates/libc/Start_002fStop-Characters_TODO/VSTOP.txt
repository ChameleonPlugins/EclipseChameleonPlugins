This is the subscript for the STOP character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VSTOP] holds the character
itself.

The STOP character is used to support the IXON and IXOFF
input modes.  If IXON is set, receiving a STOP character causes
output to be suspended; the STOP character itself is discarded.  If
IXOFF is set, the system may also transmit STOP characters to the
terminal, to prevent the input queue from overflowing.

The usual value for the STOP character is C-s.  You may not be
able to change this value—the hardware may insist on using C-s
regardless of what you specify.
