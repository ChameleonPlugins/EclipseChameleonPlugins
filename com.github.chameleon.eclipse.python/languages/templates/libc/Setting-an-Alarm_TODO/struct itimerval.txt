Data Type: struct itimerval
This structure is used to specify when a timer should expire.  It contains
the following members:

struct timeval it_interval
This is the period between successive timer interrupts.  If zero, the
alarm will only be sent once.


struct timeval it_value
This is the period between now and the first timer interrupt.  If zero,
the alarm is disabled.



The struct timeval data type is described in Elapsed Time.
