The alarm function sets the real-time timer to expire in
seconds seconds.  If you want to cancel any existing alarm, you
can do this by calling alarm with a seconds argument of
zero.

The return value indicates how many seconds remain before the previous
alarm would have been sent.  If there is no previous alarm, alarm
returns zero.
