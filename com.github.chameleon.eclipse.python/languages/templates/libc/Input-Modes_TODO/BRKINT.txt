If this bit is set and IGNBRK is not set, a break condition
clears the terminal input and output queues and raises a SIGINT
signal for the foreground process group associated with the terminal.

If neither BRKINT nor IGNBRK are set, a break condition is
passed to the application as a single '\0' character if
PARMRK is not set, or otherwise as a three-character sequence
'\377', '\0', '\0'.
