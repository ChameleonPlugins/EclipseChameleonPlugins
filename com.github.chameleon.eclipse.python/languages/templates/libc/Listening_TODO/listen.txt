The listen function enables the socket socket to accept
connections, thus making it a server socket.

The argument n specifies the length of the queue for pending
connections.  When the queue fills, new clients attempting to connect
fail with ECONNREFUSED until the server calls accept to
accept a connection from the queue.

The listen function returns 0 on success and -1
on failure.  The following errno error conditions are defined
for this function:


EBADF
The argument socket is not a valid file descriptor.


ENOTSOCK
The argument socket is not a socket.


EOPNOTSUPP
The socket socket does not support this operation.
