This function opens the hosts database to begin scanning it.  You can
then call gethostent to read the entries.

If the stayopen argument is nonzero, this sets a flag so that
subsequent calls to gethostbyname or gethostbyaddr will
not close the database (as they usually would).  This makes for more
efficiency if you call those functions several times, by avoiding
reopening the database for each call.
