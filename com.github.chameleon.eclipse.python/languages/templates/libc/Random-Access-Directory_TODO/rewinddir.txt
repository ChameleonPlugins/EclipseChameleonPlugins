The rewinddir function is used to reinitialize the directory
stream dirstream, so that if you call readdir it
returns information about the first entry in the directory again.  This
function also notices if files have been added or removed to the
directory since it was opened with opendir.  (Entries for these
files might or might not be returned by readdir if they were
added or removed since you last called opendir or
rewinddir.)
