This structure is used with getrlimit to receive limit values,
and with setrlimit to specify limit values for a particular process
and resource.  It has two fields:


rlim_t rlim_cur
The current limit


rlim_t rlim_max
The maximum limit.



For getrlimit, the structure is an output; it receives the current
values.  For setrlimit, it specifies the new values.
