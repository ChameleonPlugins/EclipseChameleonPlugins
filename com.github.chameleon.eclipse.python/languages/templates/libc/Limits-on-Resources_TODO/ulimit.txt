ulimit gets the current limit or sets the current and maximum
limit for a particular resource for the calling process according to the
command cmd.a

If you are getting a limit, the command argument is the only argument.
If you are setting a limit, there is a second argument:
long int limit which is the value to which you are setting
the limit.

The cmd values and the operations they specify are:

GETFSIZE
Get the current limit on the size of a file, in units of 512 bytes.


SETFSIZE
Set the current and maximum limit on the size of a file to limit *
512 bytes.




There are also some other cmd values that may do things on some
systems, but they are not supported.

Only the superuser may increase a maximum limit.

When you successfully get a limit, the return value of ulimit is
that limit, which is never negative.  When you successfully set a limit,
the return value is zero.  When the function fails, the return value is
-1 and errno is set according to the reason:


EPERM
A process tried to increase a maximum limit, but is not superuser.
