Store the current and maximum limits for the resource resource
in *rlp.

The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure.  The
following errno error condition is possible:


EPERM

 The process tried to raise a current limit beyond the maximum limit.

 The process tried to raise a maximum limit, but is not superuser.




When the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 on a
32-bit system this function is in fact setrlimit64.  Thus, the
LFS interface transparently replaces the old interface.
