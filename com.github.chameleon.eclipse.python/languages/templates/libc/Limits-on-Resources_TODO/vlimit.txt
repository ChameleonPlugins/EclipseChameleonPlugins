vlimit sets the current limit for a resource for a process.

resource identifies the resource:


LIM_CPU
Maximum CPU time.  Same as RLIMIT_CPU for setrlimit.

LIM_FSIZE
Maximum file size.  Same as RLIMIT_FSIZE for setrlimit.

LIM_DATA
Maximum data memory.  Same as RLIMIT_DATA for setrlimit.

LIM_STACK
Maximum stack size.  Same as RLIMIT_STACK for setrlimit.

LIM_CORE
Maximum core file size.  Same as RLIMIT_COR for setrlimit.

LIM_MAXRSS
Maximum physical memory.  Same as RLIMIT_RSS for setrlimit.



The return value is zero for success, and -1 with errno set
accordingly for failure:


EPERM
The process tried to set its current limit beyond its maximum limit.
