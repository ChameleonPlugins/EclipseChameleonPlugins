The sysv_signal implements the behavior of the standard
signal function as found on SVID systems.  The difference to BSD
systems is that the handler is deinstalled after a delivery of a signal.

Compatibility Note: As said above for signal, this
function should be avoided when possible.  sigaction is the
preferred method.
