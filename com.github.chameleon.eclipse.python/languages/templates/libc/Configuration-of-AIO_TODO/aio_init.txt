This function must be called before any other AIO function.  Calling it
is completely voluntary, as it is only meant to help the AIO
implementation perform better.

Before calling the aio_init, function the members of a variable of
type struct aioinit must be initialized.  Then a reference to
this variable is passed as the parameter to aio_init which itself
may or may not pay attention to the hints.

The function has no return value and no error cases are defined.  It is
a extension which follows a proposal from the SGI implementation in
Irix 6.  It is not covered by POSIX.1b or Unix98.
