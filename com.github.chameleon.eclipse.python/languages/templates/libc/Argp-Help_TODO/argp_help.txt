This outputs a help message for the argp parser argp to
stream.  The type of messages printed will be determined by
flags.

Any options such as ‘--help’ that are implemented automatically by
argp itself will not be present in the help output; for this
reason it is best to use argp_state_help if calling from within
an argp parser function.  See Argp Helper Functions.
