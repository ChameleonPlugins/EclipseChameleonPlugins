Function: int getgrnam_r (const char *name, struct group *result_buf, char *buffer, size_t buflen, struct group **result)

This function is similar to getgrnam in that is returns
information about the group whose group name is name.  Like
getgrgid_r, it uses the user supplied buffers in
result_buf and buffer, not a static buffer.

The return values are the same as for getgrgid_r
ERANGE.
