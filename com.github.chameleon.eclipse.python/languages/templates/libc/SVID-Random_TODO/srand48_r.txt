The description of the random number generator represented by the
information in buffer is initialized similarly to what the function
srand48 does.  The state is initialized from the parameter
seedval and the parameters for the congruential formula are
initialized to their default values.

If the return value is non-negative the function call succeeded.

This function is a GNU extension and should not be used in portable
programs.
