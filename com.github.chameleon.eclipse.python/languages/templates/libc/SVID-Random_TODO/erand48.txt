Function: double erand48 (unsigned short int xsubi[3])
Preliminary:
| MT-Unsafe race:drand48
| AS-Unsafe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt
| See POSIX Safety Concepts.


This function returns a double value in the range of 0.0
to 1.0 (exclusive), similarly to drand48.  The argument is
an array describing the state of the random number generator.

This function can be called subsequently since it updates the array to
guarantee random numbers.  The array should have been initialized before
initial use to obtain reproducible results.
