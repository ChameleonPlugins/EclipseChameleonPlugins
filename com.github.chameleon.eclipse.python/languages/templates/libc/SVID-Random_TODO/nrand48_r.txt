Function: int nrand48_r (unsigned short int xsubi[3], struct drand48_data *buffer, long int *result)
Preliminary:
| MT-Safe race:buffer
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt
| See POSIX Safety Concepts.


The nrand48_r function works like nrand48 in that it
produces a random number in the range 0 to 2^31.  But instead
of using the global parameters for the congruential formula it uses the
information from the buffer pointed to by buffer.  The state is
described by the values in xsubi.

If the return value is non-negative the variable pointed to by
result contains the result.

This function is a GNU extension and should not be used in portable
programs.
