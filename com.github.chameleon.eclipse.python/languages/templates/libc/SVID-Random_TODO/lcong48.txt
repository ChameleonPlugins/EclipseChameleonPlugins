The lcong48 function allows the user to change the complete state
of the random number generator.  Unlike srand48 and
seed48, this function also changes the constants in the
congruential formula.

From the seven elements in the array param the least significant
16 bits of the entries param[0] to param[2]
determine the initial state, the least significant 16 bits of
param[3] to param[5] determine the 48 bit
constant a and param[6] determines the 16-bit value
c.
