This function is equivalent to the drand48 function with the
difference that it does not modify the global random number generator
parameters but instead the parameters in the buffer supplied through the
pointer buffer.  The random number is returned in the variable
pointed to by result.

The return value of the function indicates whether the call succeeded.
If the value is less than 0 an error occurred and errno is
set to indicate the problem.

This function is a GNU extension and should not be used in portable
programs.
