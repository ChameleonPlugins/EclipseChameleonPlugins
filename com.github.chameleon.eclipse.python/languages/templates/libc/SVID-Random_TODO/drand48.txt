This function returns a double value in the range of 0.0
to 1.0 (exclusive).  The random bits are determined by the global
state of the random number generator in the C library.

Since the double type according to IEEE 754 has a 52-bit
mantissa this means 4 bits are not initialized by the random number
generator.  These are (of course) chosen to be the least significant
bits and they are initialized to 0.
