Function: int lcong48_r (unsigned short int param[7], struct drand48_data *buffer)
Preliminary:
| MT-Safe race:buffer
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt
| See POSIX Safety Concepts.


This function initializes all aspects of the random number generator
described in buffer with the data in param.  Here it is
especially true that the function does more than just copying the
contents of param and buffer.  More work is required and
therefore it is important to use this function rather than initializing
the random number generator directly.

If the return value is non-negative the function call succeeded.

This function is a GNU extension and should not be used in portable
programs.
