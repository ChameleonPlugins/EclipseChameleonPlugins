Function: int erand48_r (unsigned short int xsubi[3], struct drand48_data *buffer, double *result)
Preliminary:
| MT-Safe race:buffer
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt
| See POSIX Safety Concepts.


The erand48_r function works like erand48, but in addition
it takes an argument buffer which describes the random number
generator.  The state of the random number generator is taken from the
xsubi array, the parameters for the congruential formula from the
global random number generator data.  The random number is returned in
the variable pointed to by result.

The return value is non-negative if the call succeeded.

This function is a GNU extension and should not be used in portable
programs.
