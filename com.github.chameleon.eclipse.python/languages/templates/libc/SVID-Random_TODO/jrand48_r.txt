Function: int jrand48_r (unsigned short int xsubi[3], struct drand48_data *buffer, long int *result)
Preliminary:
| MT-Safe race:buffer
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt
| See POSIX Safety Concepts.


The jrand48_r function is similar to jrand48.  Like the
other reentrant functions of this function family it uses the
congruential formula parameters from the buffer pointed to by
buffer.

If the return value is non-negative the variable pointed to by
result contains the result.

This function is a GNU extension and should not be used in portable
programs.
