Function: int lrand48_r (struct drand48_data *buffer, long int *result)
Preliminary:
| MT-Safe race:buffer
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt
| See POSIX Safety Concepts.


This function is similar to lrand48, but in addition it takes a
pointer to a buffer describing the state of the random number generator
just like drand48.

If the return value of the function is non-negative the variable pointed
to by result contains the result.  Otherwise an error occurred.

This function is a GNU extension and should not be used in portable
programs.
