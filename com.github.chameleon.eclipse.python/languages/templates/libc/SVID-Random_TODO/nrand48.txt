This function is similar to the lrand48 function in that it
returns a number in the range of 0 to 2^31 (exclusive) but
the state of the random number generator used to produce the random bits
is determined by the array provided as the parameter to the function.

The numbers in the array are updated afterwards so that subsequent calls
to this function yield different results (as is expected of a random
number generator).  The array should have been initialized before the
first call to obtain reproducible results.
