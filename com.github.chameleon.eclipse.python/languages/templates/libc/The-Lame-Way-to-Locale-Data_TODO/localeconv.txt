The localeconv function returns a pointer to a structure whose
components contain information about how numeric and monetary values
should be formatted in the current locale.

You should not modify the structure or its contents.  The structure might
be overwritten by subsequent calls to localeconv, or by calls to
setlocale, but no other function in the library overwrites this
value.
