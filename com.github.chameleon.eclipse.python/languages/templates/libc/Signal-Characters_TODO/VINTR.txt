This is the subscript for the INTR character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VINTR] holds the character
itself.

The INTR (interrupt) character raises a SIGINT signal for all
processes in the foreground job associated with the terminal.  The INTR
character itself is then discarded.  See Signal Handling, for more
information about signals.

Typically, the INTR character is C-c.
