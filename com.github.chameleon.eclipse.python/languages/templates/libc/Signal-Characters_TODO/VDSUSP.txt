This is the subscript for the DSUSP character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VDSUSP] holds the character
itself.

The DSUSP (suspend) character is recognized only if the implementation
supports job control (see Job Control).  It sends a SIGTSTP
signal, like the SUSP character, but not right away—only when the
program tries to read it as input.  Not all systems with job control
support DSUSP; only BSD-compatible systems (including GNU/Hurd systems).

See Signal Handling, for more information about signals.

Typically, the DSUSP character is C-y.
