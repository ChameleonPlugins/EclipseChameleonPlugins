This is the subscript for the SUSP character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VSUSP] holds the character
itself.

The SUSP (suspend) character is recognized only if the implementation
supports job control (see Job Control).  It causes a SIGTSTP
signal to be sent to all processes in the foreground job associated with
the terminal.  The SUSP character itself is then discarded.
See Signal Handling, for more information about signals.

Typically, the SUSP character is C-z.
