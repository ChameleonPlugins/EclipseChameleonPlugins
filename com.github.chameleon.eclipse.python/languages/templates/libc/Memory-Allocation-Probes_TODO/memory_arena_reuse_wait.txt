Probe: memory_arena_reuse_wait (void *$arg1, void *$arg2, void *$arg3)
This probe is triggered when malloc is about to wait for an arena
to become available for reuse.  Argument $arg1 holds a pointer to
the mutex the thread is going to wait on, $arg2 is a pointer to a
newly-chosen arena to be reused, and $arg3 is a pointer to the
arena previously used by that thread.

This occurs within
reused_arena, when a thread first tries to allocate memory or
needs a retry after a failure to allocate from the main arena, there
isn’t any free arena, the maximum number of arenas has been reached, and
an existing arena was chosen for reuse, but its mutex could not be
immediately acquired.  The mutex in $arg1 is the mutex of the
selected arena.
