The parameter string should contain a string which was produced by
a call to l64a.  The function processes at least 6 characters of
this string, and decodes the characters it finds according to the table
below.  It stops decoding when it finds a character not in the table,
rather like atoi; if you have a buffer which has been broken into
lines, you must be careful to skip over the end-of-line characters.

The decoded number is returned as a long int value.
