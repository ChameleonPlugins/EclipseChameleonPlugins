The strchr function finds the first occurrence of the character
c (converted to a char) in the null-terminated string
beginning at string.  The return value is a pointer to the located
character, or a null pointer if no match was found.

For example,

strchr (&quot;hello, world&quot;, 'l')
    ? &quot;llo, world&quot;
strchr (&quot;hello, world&quot;, '?')
    ? NULL


The terminating null character is considered to be part of the string,
so you can use this function get a pointer to the end of a string by
specifying a null character as the value of the c argument.

When strchr returns a null pointer, it does not let you know
the position of the terminating null character it has found.  If you
need that information, it is better (but less portable) to use
strchrnul than to search for it a second time.
