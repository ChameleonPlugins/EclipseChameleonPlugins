The strcspn (“string complement span”) function returns the length
of the initial substring of string that consists entirely of characters
that are not members of the set specified by the string stopset.
(In other words, it returns the offset of the first character in string
that is a member of the set stopset.)

For example,

strcspn (&quot;hello, world&quot;, &quot; \t\n,.;!?&quot;)
    ? 5


Note that “character” is here used in the sense of byte.  In a string
using a multibyte character encoding (abstract) character consisting of
more than one byte are not treated as an entity.  Each byte is treated
separately.  The function is not locale-dependent.
