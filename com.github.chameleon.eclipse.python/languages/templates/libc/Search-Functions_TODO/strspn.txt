The strspn (“string span”) function returns the length of the
initial substring of string that consists entirely of characters that
are members of the set specified by the string skipset.  The order
of the characters in skipset is not important.

For example,

strspn (&quot;hello, world&quot;, &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;)
    ? 5


Note that “character” is here used in the sense of byte.  In a string
using a multibyte character encoding (abstract) character consisting of
more than one byte are not treated as an entity.  Each byte is treated
separately.  The function is not locale-dependent.
