This probe is triggered whenever longjmp or siglongjmp
is called.  Argument $arg1 is a pointer to the jmp_buf
passed as the first argument of longjmp or siglongjmp,
$arg2 is the return value passed as the second argument of
longjmp or siglongjmp and $arg3 is a pointer to
the return address longjmp or siglongjmp will return to.

The longjmp probe is triggered at a point where the registers
have not yet been restored to the values in the jmp_buf and
unwinding will show a call stack including the caller of
longjmp or siglongjmp.
