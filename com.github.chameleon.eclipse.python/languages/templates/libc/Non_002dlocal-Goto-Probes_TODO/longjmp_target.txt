This probe is triggered under the same conditions and with the same
arguments as the longjmp probe.

The longjmp_target probe is triggered at a point where the
registers have been restored to the values in the jmp_buf and
unwinding will show a call stack including the caller of setjmp
or sigsetjmp.
