The fgetgrent function reads the next entry from stream.
It returns a pointer to the entry.  The structure is statically
allocated and is overwritten on subsequent calls to fgetgrent.  You
must copy the contents of the structure if you wish to save the
information.

The stream must correspond to a file in the same format as the standard
group database file.
