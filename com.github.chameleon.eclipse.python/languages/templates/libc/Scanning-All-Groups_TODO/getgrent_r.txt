This function is similar to getgrent in that it returns the next
entry from the stream initialized by setgrent.  Like
fgetgrent_r, it places the result in user-supplied buffers
pointed to result_buf and buffer.

If the function returns zero result contains a pointer to the data
(normally equal to result_buf).  If errors occurred the return
value is non-zero and result contains a null pointer.
