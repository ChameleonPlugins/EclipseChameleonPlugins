This function is similar to fgetgrent in that it reads the next
user entry from stream.  But the result is returned in the
structure pointed to by result_buf.  The first buflen bytes
of the additional buffer pointed to by buffer are used to contain
additional information, normally strings which are pointed to by the
elements of the result structure.

This stream must correspond to a file in the same format as the standard
group database file.

If the function returns zero result points to the structure with
the wanted data (normally this is in result_buf).  If errors
occurred the return value is non-zero and result contains a null
pointer.
