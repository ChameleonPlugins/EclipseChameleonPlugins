This function returns the process group ID of the foreground process
group associated with the terminal open on descriptor filedes.

If there is no foreground process group, the return value is a number
greater than 1 that does not match the process group ID of any
existing process group.  This can happen if all of the processes in the
job that was formerly the foreground job have terminated, and no other
job has yet been moved into the foreground.

In case of an error, a value of -1 is returned.  The
following errno error conditions are defined for this function:


EBADF
The filedes argument is not a valid file descriptor.


ENOSYS
The system doesn’t support job control.


ENOTTY
The terminal file associated with the filedes argument isn’t the
controlling terminal of the calling process.
