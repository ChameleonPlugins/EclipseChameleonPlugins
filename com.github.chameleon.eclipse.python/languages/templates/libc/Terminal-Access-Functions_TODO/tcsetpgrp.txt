This function is used to set a terminal’s foreground process group ID.
The argument filedes is a descriptor which specifies the terminal;
pgid specifies the process group.  The calling process must be a
member of the same session as pgid and must have the same
controlling terminal.

For terminal access purposes, this function is treated as output.  If it
is called from a background process on its controlling terminal,
normally all processes in the process group are sent a SIGTTOU
signal.  The exception is if the calling process itself is ignoring or
blocking SIGTTOU signals, in which case the operation is
performed and no signal is sent.

If successful, tcsetpgrp returns 0.  A return value of
-1 indicates an error.  The following errno error
conditions are defined for this function:


EBADF
The filedes argument is not a valid file descriptor.


EINVAL
The pgid argument is not valid.


ENOSYS
The system doesn’t support job control.


ENOTTY
The filedes isn’t the controlling terminal of the calling process.


EPERM
The pgid isn’t a process group in the same session as the calling
process.
