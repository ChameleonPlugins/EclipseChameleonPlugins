This is like chown, except that it changes the owner of the open
file with descriptor filedes.

The return value from fchown is 0 on success and -1
on failure.  The following errno error codes are defined for this
function:


EBADF
The filedes argument is not a valid file descriptor.


EINVAL
The filedes argument corresponds to a pipe or socket, not an ordinary
file.


EPERM
This process lacks permission to make the requested change.  For details
see chmod above.


EROFS
The file resides on a read-only file system.
