This function raises the supported exceptions indicated by
excepts.  If more than one exception bit in excepts is set
the order in which the exceptions are raised is undefined except that
overflow (FE_OVERFLOW) or underflow (FE_UNDERFLOW) are
raised before inexact (FE_INEXACT).  Whether for overflow or
underflow the inexact exception is also raised is also implementation
dependent.

The function returns zero in case the operation was successful, a
non-zero value otherwise.
