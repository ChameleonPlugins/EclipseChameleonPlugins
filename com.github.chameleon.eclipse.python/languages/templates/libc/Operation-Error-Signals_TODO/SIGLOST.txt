Resource lost.  This signal is generated when you have an advisory lock
on an NFS file, and the NFS server reboots and forgets about your lock.

On GNU/Hurd systems, SIGLOST is generated when any server program
dies unexpectedly.  It is usually fine to ignore the signal; whatever
call was made to the server that died just returns an error.
