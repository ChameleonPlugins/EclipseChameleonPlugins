This function converts an Internet address (either IPv4 or IPv6) from
network (binary) to presentation (textual) form.  af should be
either AF_INET or AF_INET6, as appropriate.  cp is a
pointer to the address to be converted.  buf should be a pointer
to a buffer to hold the result, and len is the length of this
buffer.  The return value from the function will be this buffer address.
