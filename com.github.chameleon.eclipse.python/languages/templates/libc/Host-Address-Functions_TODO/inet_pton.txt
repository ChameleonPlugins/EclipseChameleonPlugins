This function converts an Internet address (either IPv4 or IPv6) from
presentation (textual) to network (binary) format.  af should be
either AF_INET or AF_INET6, as appropriate for the type of
address being converted.  cp is a pointer to the input string, and
buf is a pointer to a buffer for the result.  It is the caller’s
responsibility to make sure the buffer is large enough.
