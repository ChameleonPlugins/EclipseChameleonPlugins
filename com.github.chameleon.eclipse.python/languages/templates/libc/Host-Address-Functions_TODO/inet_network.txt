This function extracts the network number from the address name,
given in the standard numbers-and-dots notation.  The returned address is
in host order.  If the input is not valid, inet_network returns
-1.

The function works only with traditional IPv4 class A, B and C network
types.  It doesn’t work with classless addresses and shouldn’t be used
anymore.
