This function converts the IPv4 Internet host address name from the
standard numbers-and-dots notation into binary data.  If the input is
not valid, inet_addr returns INADDR_NONE.  This is an
obsolete interface to inet_aton, described immediately above.  It
is obsolete because INADDR_NONE is a valid address
(255.255.255.255), and inet_aton provides a cleaner way to
indicate error return.
