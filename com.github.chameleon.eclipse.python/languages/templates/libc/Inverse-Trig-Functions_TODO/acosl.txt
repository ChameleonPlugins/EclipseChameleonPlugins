These functions compute the arc cosine of x—that is, the value
whose cosine is x.  The value is in units of radians.
Mathematically, there are infinitely many such values; the one actually
returned is the one between 0 and pi (inclusive).

The arc cosine function is defined mathematically only
over the domain -1 to 1.  If x is outside the
domain, acos signals a domain error.
