These functions compute the arc sine of x—that is, the value whose
sine is x.  The value is in units of radians.  Mathematically,
there are infinitely many such values; the one actually returned is the
one between -pi/2 and pi/2 (inclusive).

The arc sine function is defined mathematically only
over the domain -1 to 1.  If x is outside the
domain, asin signals a domain error.
