The wcstombs (“wide character string to multibyte string”)
function converts the null-terminated wide character array wstring
into a string containing multibyte characters, storing not more than
size bytes starting at string, followed by a terminating
null character if there is room.  The conversion of characters begins in
the initial shift state.

The terminating null character counts towards the size, so if size
is less than or equal to the number of bytes needed in wstring, no
terminating null character is stored.

If a code that does not correspond to a valid multibyte character is
found, the wcstombs function returns a value of -1.
Otherwise, the return value is the number of bytes stored in the array
string.  This number does not include the terminating null character,
which is present if the number is less than size.
