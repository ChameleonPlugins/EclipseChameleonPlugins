This function is used to set the process’s working directory to
filename.

The normal, successful return value from chdir is 0.  A
value of -1 is returned to indicate an error.  The errno
error conditions defined for this function are the usual file name
syntax errors (see File Name Errors), plus ENOTDIR if the
file filename is not a directory.
