This get_current_dir_name function is basically equivalent to
getcwd (NULL, 0).  The only difference is that the value of
the PWD variable is returned if this value is correct.  This is a
subtle difference which is visible if the path described by the
PWD value is using one or more symbol links in which case the
value returned by getcwd can resolve the symbol links and
therefore yield a different result.

This function is a GNU extension.
