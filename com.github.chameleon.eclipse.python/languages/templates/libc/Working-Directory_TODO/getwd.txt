This is similar to getcwd, but has no way to specify the size of
the buffer.  The GNU C Library provides getwd only
for backwards compatibility with BSD.

The buffer argument should be a pointer to an array at least
PATH_MAX bytes long (see Limits for Files).  On GNU/Hurd systems
there is no limit to the size of a file name, so this is not
necessarily enough space to contain the directory name.  That is why
this function is deprecated.
