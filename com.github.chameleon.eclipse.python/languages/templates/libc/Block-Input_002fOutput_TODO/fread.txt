This function reads up to count objects of size size into
the array data, from the stream stream.  It returns the
number of objects actually read, which might be less than count if
a read error occurs or the end of the file is reached.  This function
returns a value of zero (and doesn’t read anything) if either size
or count is zero.

If fread encounters end of file in the middle of an object, it
returns the number of complete objects read, and discards the partial
object.  Therefore, the stream remains at the actual end of the file.
