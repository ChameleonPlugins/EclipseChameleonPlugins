The getutent function reads the next entry from the user
accounting database.  It returns a pointer to the entry, which is
statically allocated and may be overwritten by subsequent calls to
getutent.  You must copy the contents of the structure if you
wish to save the information or you can use the getutent_r
function which stores the data in a user-provided buffer.

A null pointer is returned in case no further entry is available.
