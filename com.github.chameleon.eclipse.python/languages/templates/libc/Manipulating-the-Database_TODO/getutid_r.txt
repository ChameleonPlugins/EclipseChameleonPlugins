This function retrieves just like getutid the next entry matching
the information stored in id.  But the result is stored in the
buffer pointed to by the parameter buffer.

If successful the function returns 0 and the pointer variable
pointed to by the parameter result contains a pointer to the
buffer with the result (probably the same as result.  If not
successful the function return -1.

This function is a GNU extension.
