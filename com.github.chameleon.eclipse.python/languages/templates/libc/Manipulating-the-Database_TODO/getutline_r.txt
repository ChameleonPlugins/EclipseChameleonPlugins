This function retrieves just like getutline the next entry
matching the information stored in line.  But the result is stored
in the buffer pointed to by the parameter buffer.

If successful the function returns 0 and the pointer variable
pointed to by the parameter result contains a pointer to the
buffer with the result (probably the same as result.  If not
successful the function return -1.

This function is a GNU extension.
