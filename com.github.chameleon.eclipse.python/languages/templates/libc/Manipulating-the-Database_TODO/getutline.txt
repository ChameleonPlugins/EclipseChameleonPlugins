This function searches forward from the current point in the database
until it finds an entry whose ut_type value is
LOGIN_PROCESS or USER_PROCESS, and whose ut_line
member matches the ut_line member of the line structure.
If it finds such an entry, it returns a pointer to the entry which is
statically allocated, and may be overwritten by a subsequent call to
getutent, getutid or getutline.  You must copy the
contents of the structure if you wish to save the information.

A null pointer is returned in case the end of the database is reached
without a match.

The getutline function may cache the last read entry.  Therefore
if you are using getutline to search for multiple occurrences, it
is necessary to zero out the static data after each call.  Otherwise
getutline could just return a pointer to the same entry over and
over again.
