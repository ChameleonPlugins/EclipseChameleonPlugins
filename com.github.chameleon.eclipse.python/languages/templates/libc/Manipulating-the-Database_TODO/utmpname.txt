The utmpname function changes the name of the database to be
examined to file, and closes any previously opened database.  By
default getutent, getutid, getutline and
pututline read from and write to the user accounting database.

The following macros are defined for use as the file argument:


Macro: char * _PATH_UTMP
This macro is used to specify the user accounting database.



Macro: char * _PATH_WTMP
This macro is used to specify the user accounting log file.


The utmpname function returns a value of 0 if the new name
was successfully stored, and a value of -1 to indicate an error.
Note that utmpname does not try to open the database, and that
therefore the return value does not say anything about whether the
database can be successfully opened.
