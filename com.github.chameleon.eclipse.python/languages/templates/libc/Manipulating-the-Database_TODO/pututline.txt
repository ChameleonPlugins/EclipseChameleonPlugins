The pututline function inserts the entry *utmp at
the appropriate place in the user accounting database.  If it finds that
it is not already at the correct place in the database, it uses
getutid to search for the position to insert the entry, however
this will not modify the static structure returned by getutent,
getutid and getutline.  If this search fails, the entry
is appended to the database.

The pututline function returns a pointer to a copy of the entry
inserted in the user accounting database, or a null pointer if the entry
could not be added.  The following errno error conditions are
defined for this function:


EPERM
The process does not have the appropriate privileges; you cannot modify
the user accounting database.
