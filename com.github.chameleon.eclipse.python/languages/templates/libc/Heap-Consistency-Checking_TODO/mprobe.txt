The mprobe function lets you explicitly check for inconsistencies
in a particular allocated block.  You must have already called
mcheck at the beginning of the program, to do its occasional
checks; calling mprobe requests an additional consistency check
to be done at the time of the call.

The argument pointer must be a pointer returned by malloc
or realloc.  mprobe returns a value that says what
inconsistency, if any, was found.  The values are described below.
