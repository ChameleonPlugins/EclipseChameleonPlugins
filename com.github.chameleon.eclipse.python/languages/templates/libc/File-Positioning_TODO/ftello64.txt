This function is similar to ftello with the only difference that
the return value is of type off64_t.  This also requires that the
stream stream was opened using either fopen64,
freopen64, or tmpfile64 since otherwise the underlying
file operations to position the file pointer beyond the 2^31
bytes limit might fail.

If the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 on a 32
bits machine this function is available under the name ftello
and so transparently replaces the old interface.
