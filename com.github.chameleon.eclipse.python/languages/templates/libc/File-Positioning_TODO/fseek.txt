The fseek function is used to change the file position of the
stream stream.  The value of whence must be one of the
constants SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, to
indicate whether the offset is relative to the beginning of the
file, the current file position, or the end of the file, respectively.

This function returns a value of zero if the operation was successful,
and a nonzero value to indicate failure.  A successful call also clears
the end-of-file indicator of stream and discards any characters
that were “pushed back” by the use of ungetc.

fseek either flushes any buffered output before setting the file
position or else remembers it so it will be written later in its proper
place in the file.
