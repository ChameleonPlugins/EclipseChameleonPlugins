Variable: argp_program_version_hook
If defined or set by the user program to a non-zero value, a
‘--version’ option is added when parsing with arg_parse,
which prints the program version and exits with a status of zero.  This
is not the case if the ARGP_NO_HELP flag is used.  If the
ARGP_NO_EXIT flag is set, the exit behavior of the program is
suppressed or modified, as when the argp parser is going to be used by
other programs.

It should point to a function with this type of signature:


void print-version (FILE *stream, struct argp_state *state)


See Argp Parsing State, for an explanation of state.

This variable takes precedence over argp_program_version, and is
useful if a program has version information not easily expressed in a
simple string.
