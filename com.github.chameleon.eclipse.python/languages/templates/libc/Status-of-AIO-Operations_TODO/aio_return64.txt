This function is similar to aio_return with the only difference
that the argument is a reference to a variable of type struct
aiocb64.

When the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 this
function is available under the name aio_return and so
transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32 bit
machines.
