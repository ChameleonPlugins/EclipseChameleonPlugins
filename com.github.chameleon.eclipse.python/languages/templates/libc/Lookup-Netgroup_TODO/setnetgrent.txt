A call to this function initializes the internal state of the library to
allow following calls of the getnetgrent to iterate over all entries
in the netgroup with name netgroup.

When the call is successful (i.e., when a netgroup with this name exists)
the return value is 1.  When the return value is 0 no
netgroup of this name is known or some other error occurred.
