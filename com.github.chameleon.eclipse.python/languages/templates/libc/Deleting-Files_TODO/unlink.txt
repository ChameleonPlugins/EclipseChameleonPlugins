The unlink function deletes the file name filename.  If
this is a file’s sole name, the file itself is also deleted.  (Actually,
if any process has the file open when this happens, deletion is
postponed until all processes have closed the file.)


The function unlink is declared in the header file unistd.h.

This function returns 0 on successful completion, and -1
on error.  In addition to the usual file name errors
(see File Name Errors), the following errno error conditions are
defined for this function:


EACCES
Write permission is denied for the directory from which the file is to be
removed, or the directory has the sticky bit set and you do not own the file.


EBUSY
This error indicates that the file is being used by the system in such a
way that it can’t be unlinked.  For example, you might see this error if
the file name specifies the root directory or a mount point for a file
system.


ENOENT
The file name to be deleted doesn’t exist.


EPERM
On some systems unlink cannot be used to delete the name of a
directory, or at least can only be used this way by a privileged user.
To avoid such problems, use rmdir to delete directories.  (On
GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd systems unlink can never delete the name of a directory.)


EROFS
The directory containing the file name to be deleted is on a read-only
file system and can’t be modified.
