This function sets both the absolute priority and the scheduling policy
for a process.

It assigns the absolute priority value given by param and the
scheduling policy policy to the process with Process ID pid,
or the calling process if pid is zero.  If policy is
negative, sched_setscheduler keeps the existing scheduling policy.

The following macros represent the valid values for policy:


SCHED_OTHER
Traditional Scheduling

SCHED_FIFO
First In First Out

SCHED_RR
Round Robin




On success, the return value is 0.  Otherwise, it is -1
and ERRNO is set accordingly.  The errno values specific
to this function are:


EPERM

 The calling process does not have CAP_SYS_NICE permission and
policy is not SCHED_OTHER (or it’s negative and the
existing policy is not SCHED_OTHER.

 The calling process does not have CAP_SYS_NICE permission and its
owner is not the target process’ owner.  I.e., the effective uid of the
calling process is neither the effective nor the real uid of process
pid.



ESRCH
There is no process with pid pid and pid is not zero.


EINVAL

 policy does not identify an existing scheduling policy.

 The absolute priority value identified by *param is outside the
valid range for the scheduling policy policy (or the existing
scheduling policy if policy is negative) or param is
null.  sched_get_priority_max and sched_get_priority_min
tell you what the valid range is.

 pid is negative.
