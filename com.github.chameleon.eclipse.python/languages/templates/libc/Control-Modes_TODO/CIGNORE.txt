If this bit is set, it says to ignore the control modes and line speed
values entirely.  This is only meaningful in a call to tcsetattr.

The c_cflag member and the line speed values returned by
cfgetispeed and cfgetospeed will be unaffected by the
call.  CIGNORE is useful if you want to set all the software
modes in the other members, but leave the hardware details in
c_cflag unchanged.  (This is how the TCSASOFT flag to
tcsettattr works.)

This bit is never set in the structure filled in by tcgetattr.
