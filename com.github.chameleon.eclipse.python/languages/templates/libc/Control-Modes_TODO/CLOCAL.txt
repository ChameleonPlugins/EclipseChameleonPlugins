If this bit is set, it indicates that the terminal is connected
“locally” and that the modem status lines (such as carrier detect)
should be ignored.



On many systems if this bit is not set and you call open without
the O_NONBLOCK flag set, open blocks until a modem
connection is established.

If this bit is not set and a modem disconnect is detected, a
SIGHUP signal is sent to the controlling process group for the
terminal (if it has one).  Normally, this causes the process to exit;
see Signal Handling.  Reading from the terminal after a disconnect
causes an end-of-file condition, and writing causes an EIO error
to be returned.  The terminal device must be closed and reopened to
clear the condition.
