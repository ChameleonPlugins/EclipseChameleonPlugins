Obsolete function: int creat (const char *filename, mode_t mode)

This function is obsolete.  The call:


creat (filename, mode)


is equivalent to:


open (filename, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, mode)


If on a 32 bit machine the sources are translated with
_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 the function creat returns a file
descriptor opened in the large file mode which enables the file handling
functions to use files up to 2^63 in size and offset from
-2^63 to 2^63.  This happens transparently for the user
since all of the lowlevel file handling functions are equally replaced.
