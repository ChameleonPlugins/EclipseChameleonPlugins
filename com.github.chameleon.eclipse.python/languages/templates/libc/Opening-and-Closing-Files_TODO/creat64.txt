This function is similar to creat.  It returns a file descriptor
which can be used to access the file named by filename.  The only
the difference is that on 32 bit systems the file is opened in the
large file mode.  I.e., file length and file offsets can exceed 31 bits.

To use this file descriptor one must not use the normal operations but
instead the counterparts named *64, e.g., read64.

When the sources are translated with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 this
function is actually available under the name open.  I.e., the
new, extended API using 64 bit file sizes and offsets transparently
replaces the old API.
