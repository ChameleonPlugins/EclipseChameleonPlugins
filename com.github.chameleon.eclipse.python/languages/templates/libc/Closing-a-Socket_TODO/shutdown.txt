The shutdown function shuts down the connection of socket
socket.  The argument how specifies what action to
perform:


0
Stop receiving data for this socket.  If further data arrives,
reject it.


1
Stop trying to transmit data from this socket.  Discard any data
waiting to be sent.  Stop looking for acknowledgement of data already
sent; don’t retransmit it if it is lost.


2
Stop both reception and transmission.



The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure.  The
following errno error conditions are defined for this function:


EBADF
socket is not a valid file descriptor.


ENOTSOCK
socket is not a socket.


ENOTCONN
socket is not connected.
