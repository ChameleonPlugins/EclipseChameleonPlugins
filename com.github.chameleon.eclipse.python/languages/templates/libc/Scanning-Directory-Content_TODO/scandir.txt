Function: int scandir (const char *dir, struct dirent ***namelist, int (*selector) (const struct dirent *), int (*cmp) (const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **))

The scandir function scans the contents of the directory selected
by dir.  The result in *namelist is an array of pointers to
structure of type struct dirent which describe all selected
directory entries and which is allocated using malloc.  Instead
of always getting all directory entries returned, the user supplied
function selector can be used to decide which entries are in the
result.  Only the entries for which selector returns a non-zero
value are selected.

Finally the entries in *namelist are sorted using the
user-supplied function cmp.  The arguments passed to the cmp
function are of type struct dirent **, therefore one cannot
directly use the strcmp or strcoll functions; instead see
the functions alphasort and versionsort below.

The return value of the function is the number of entries placed in
*namelist.  If it is -1 an error occurred (either the
directory could not be opened for reading or the malloc call failed) and
the global variable errno contains more information on the error.
