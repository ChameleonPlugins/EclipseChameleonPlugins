The alphasort function behaves like the strcoll function
(see String/Array Comparison).  The difference is that the arguments
are not string pointers but instead they are of type
struct dirent **.

The return value of alphasort is less than, equal to, or greater
than zero depending on the order of the two entries a and b.
