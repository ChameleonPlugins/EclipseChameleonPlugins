This function reads a word (that is, an int) from stream.
It’s provided for compatibility with SVID.  We recommend you use
fread instead (see Block Input/Output).  Unlike getc,
any int value could be a valid result.  getw returns
EOF when it encounters end-of-file or an error, but there is no
way to distinguish this from an input word with value -1.
