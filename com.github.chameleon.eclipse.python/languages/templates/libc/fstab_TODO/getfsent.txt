This function returns the next entry of the fstab file.  If this
is the first call to any of the functions handling fstab since
program start or the last call of endfsent, the file will be
opened.

The function returns a pointer to a variable of type struct
fstab.  This variable is shared by all threads and therefore this
function is not thread-safe.  If an error occurred getfsent
returns a NULL pointer.
