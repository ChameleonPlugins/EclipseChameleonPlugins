The SIGHUP (“hang-up”) signal is used to report that the user’s
terminal is disconnected, perhaps because a network or telephone
connection was broken.  For more information about this, see Control Modes.

This signal is also used to report the termination of the controlling
process on a terminal to jobs associated with that session; this
termination effectively disconnects all processes in the session from
the controlling terminal.  For more information, see Termination Internals.
