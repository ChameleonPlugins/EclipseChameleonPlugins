The wcslen function is the wide character equivalent to
strlen.  The return value is the number of wide characters in the
wide character string pointed to by ws (this is also the offset of
the terminating null wide character of ws).

Since there are no multi wide character sequences making up one
character the return value is not only the offset in the array, it is
also the number of wide characters.

This function was introduced in Amendment 1 to ISO C90.
