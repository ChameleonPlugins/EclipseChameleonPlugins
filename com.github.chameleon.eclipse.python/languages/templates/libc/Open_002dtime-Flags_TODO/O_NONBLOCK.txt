This prevents open from blocking for a “long time” to open the
file.  This is only meaningful for some kinds of files, usually devices
such as serial ports; when it is not meaningful, it is harmless and
ignored.  Often opening a port to a modem blocks until the modem reports
carrier detection; if O_NONBLOCK is specified, open will
return immediately without a carrier.

Note that the O_NONBLOCK flag is overloaded as both an I/O operating
mode and a file name translation flag.  This means that specifying
O_NONBLOCK in open also sets nonblocking I/O mode;
see Operating Modes.  To open the file without blocking but do normal
I/O that blocks, you must call open with O_NONBLOCK set and
then call fcntl to turn the bit off.
