Macro: int O_TRUNC
Truncate the file to zero length.  This option is only useful for
regular files, not special files such as directories or FIFOs.  POSIX.1
requires that you open the file for writing to use O_TRUNC.  In
BSD and GNU you must have permission to write the file to truncate it,
but you need not open for write access.

This is the only open-time action flag specified by POSIX.1.  There is
no good reason for truncation to be done by open, instead of by
calling ftruncate afterwards.  The O_TRUNC flag existed in
Unix before ftruncate was invented, and is retained for backward
compatibility.
