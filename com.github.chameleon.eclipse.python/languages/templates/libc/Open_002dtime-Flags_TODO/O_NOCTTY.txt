Macro: int O_NOCTTY
If the named file is a terminal device, don’t make it the controlling
terminal for the process.  See Job Control, for information about
what it means to be the controlling terminal.

On GNU/Hurd systems and 4.4 BSD, opening a file never makes it the
controlling terminal and O_NOCTTY is zero.  However, GNU/Linux systems
and some other systems use a nonzero value for O_NOCTTY and set the
controlling terminal when you open a file that is a terminal device; so
to be portable, use O_NOCTTY when it is important to avoid this.
