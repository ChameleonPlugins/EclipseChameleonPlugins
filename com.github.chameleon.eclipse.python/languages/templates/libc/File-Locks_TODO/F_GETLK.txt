Macro: int F_GETLK
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to
specify that it should get information about a lock.  This command
requires a third argument of type struct flock * to be passed
to fcntl, so that the form of the call is:


fcntl (filedes, F_GETLK, lockp)


If there is a lock already in place that would block the lock described
by the lockp argument, information about that lock overwrites
*lockp.  Existing locks are not reported if they are
compatible with making a new lock as specified.  Thus, you should
specify a lock type of F_WRLCK if you want to find out about both
read and write locks, or F_RDLCK if you want to find out about
write locks only.

There might be more than one lock affecting the region specified by the
lockp argument, but fcntl only returns information about
one of them.  The l_whence member of the lockp structure is
set to SEEK_SET and the l_start and l_len fields
set to identify the locked region.

If no lock applies, the only change to the lockp structure is to
update the l_type to a value of F_UNLCK.

The normal return value from fcntl with this command is an
unspecified value other than -1, which is reserved to indicate an
error.  The following errno error conditions are defined for
this command:


EBADF
The filedes argument is invalid.


EINVAL
Either the lockp argument doesn’t specify valid lock information,
or the file associated with filedes doesn’t support locks.
