Returns true if wc is an alphabetic character (a letter).  If
iswlower or iswupper is true of a character, then
iswalpha is also true.

In some locales, there may be additional characters for which
iswalpha is true—letters which are neither upper case nor lower
case.  But in the standard &quot;C&quot; locale, there are no such
additional characters.

This function can be implemented using


iswctype (wc, wctype (&quot;alpha&quot;))



It is declared in wctype.h.
