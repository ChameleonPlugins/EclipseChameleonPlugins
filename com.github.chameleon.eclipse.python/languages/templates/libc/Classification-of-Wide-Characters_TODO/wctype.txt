The wctype returns a value representing a class of wide
characters which is identified by the string property.  Beside
some standard properties each locale can define its own ones.  In case
no property with the given name is known for the current locale
selected for the LC_CTYPE category, the function returns zero.

The properties known in every locale are:


&quot;alnum&quot;&quot;alpha&quot;&quot;cntrl&quot;&quot;digit&quot;
&quot;graph&quot;&quot;lower&quot;&quot;print&quot;&quot;punct&quot;
&quot;space&quot;&quot;upper&quot;&quot;xdigit&quot;



This function is declared in wctype.h.
