The __freading function determines whether the stream
stream was last read from or whether it is opened read-only.  In
this case the return value is nonzero, otherwise it is zero.
Determining whether a stream opened for reading and writing was last
used for writing allows to draw conclusions about the content about the
buffer, among other things.

This function is declared in stdio_ext.h.
