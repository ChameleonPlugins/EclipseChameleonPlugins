This function is similar to freopen.  The only difference is that
on 32 bit machine the stream returned is able to read beyond the
2^31 bytes limits imposed by the normal interface.  It should be
noted that the stream pointed to by stream need not be opened
using fopen64 or freopen64 since its mode is not important
for this function.

If the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 on a 32
bits machine this function is available under the name freopen
and so transparently replaces the old interface.
