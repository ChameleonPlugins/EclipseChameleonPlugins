Initialize obstack obstack-ptr for allocation of objects.  This
function calls the obstack’s obstack_chunk_alloc function.  If
allocation of memory fails, the function pointed to by
obstack_alloc_failed_handler is called.  The obstack_init
function always returns 1 (Compatibility notice: Former versions of
obstack returned 0 if allocation failed).
