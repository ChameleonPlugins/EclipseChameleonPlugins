Macro: const float complex I
This macro has exactly the same value as _Complex_I.  Most of the
time it is preferable.  However, it causes problems if you want to use
the identifier I for something else.  You can safely write


#include &lt;complex.h&gt;
#undef I


if you need I for your own purposes.  (In that case we recommend
you also define some other short name for _Complex_I, such as
J.)
