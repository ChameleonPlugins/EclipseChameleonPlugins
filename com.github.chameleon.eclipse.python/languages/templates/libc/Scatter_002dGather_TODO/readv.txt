The readv function reads data from filedes and scatters it
into the buffers described in vector, which is taken to be
count structures long.  As each buffer is filled, data is sent to the
next.

Note that readv is not guaranteed to fill all the buffers.
It may stop at any point, for the same reasons read would.

The return value is a count of bytes (not buffers) read, 0
indicating end-of-file, or -1 indicating an error.  The possible
errors are the same as in read.
