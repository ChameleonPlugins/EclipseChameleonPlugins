The writev function gathers data from the buffers described in
vector, which is taken to be count structures long, and writes
them to filedes.  As each buffer is written, it moves on to the
next.

Like readv, writev may stop midstream under the same
conditions write would.

The return value is a count of bytes written, or -1 indicating an
error.  The possible errors are the same as in write.
