Macro: int MB_CUR_MAX
MB_CUR_MAX expands into a positive integer expression that is the
maximum number of bytes in a multibyte character in the current locale.
The value is never greater than MB_LEN_MAX.  Unlike
MB_LEN_MAX this macro need not be a compile-time constant, and in
the GNU C Library it is not.


MB_CUR_MAX is defined in stdlib.h.
