These functions return the absolute  value of the complex number z
(see Complex Numbers).  The absolute value of a complex number is:


sqrt (creal (z) * creal (z) + cimag (z) * cimag (z))


This function should always be used instead of the direct formula
because it takes special care to avoid losing precision.  It may also
take advantage of hardware support for this operation.  See hypot
in Exponents and Logarithms.
