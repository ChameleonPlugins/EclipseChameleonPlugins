These functions return the absolute value of number.

Most computers use a two’s complement integer representation, in which
the absolute value of INT_MIN (the smallest possible int)
cannot be represented; thus, abs (INT_MIN) is not defined.

llabs and imaxdiv are new to ISO C99.

See Integers for a description of the intmax_t type.
