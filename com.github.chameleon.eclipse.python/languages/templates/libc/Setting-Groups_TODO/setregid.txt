This function sets the real group ID of the process to rgid and
the effective group ID to egid.  If rgid is -1, it
means not to change the real group ID; likewise if egid is
-1, it means not to change the effective group ID.

The setregid function is provided for compatibility with 4.3 BSD
Unix, which does not support file IDs.  You can use this function to
swap the effective and real group IDs of the process.  (Privileged
processes are not limited to this usage.)  If file IDs are supported,
you should use that feature instead of using this function.
See Enable/Disable Setuid.

The return values and error conditions for setregid are the same
as those for setreuid.
