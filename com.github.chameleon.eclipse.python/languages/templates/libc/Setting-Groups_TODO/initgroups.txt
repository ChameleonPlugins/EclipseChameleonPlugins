The initgroups function sets the process’s supplementary group
IDs to be the normal default for the user name user.  The group
group is automatically included.

This function works by scanning the group database for all the groups
user belongs to.  It then calls setgroups with the list it
has constructed.

The return values and error conditions are the same as for
setgroups.
