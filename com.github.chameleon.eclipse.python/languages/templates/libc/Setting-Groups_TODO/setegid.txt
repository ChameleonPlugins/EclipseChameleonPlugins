This function sets the effective group ID of the process to
newgid, provided that the process is allowed to change its group
ID.  Just as with seteuid, if the process is privileged it may
change its effective group ID to any value; if it isn’t, but it has a
file group ID, then it may change to its real group ID or file group ID;
otherwise it may not change its effective group ID.

Note that a process is only privileged if its effective user ID
is zero.  The effective group ID only affects access permissions.

The return values and error conditions for setegid are the same
as those for seteuid.

This function is only present if _POSIX_SAVED_IDS is defined.
