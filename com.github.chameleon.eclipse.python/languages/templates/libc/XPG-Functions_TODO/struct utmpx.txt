Data Type: struct utmpx
The utmpx data structure contains at least the following members:


short int ut_type
Specifies the type of login; one of EMPTY, RUN_LVL,
BOOT_TIME, OLD_TIME, NEW_TIME, INIT_PROCESS,
LOGIN_PROCESS, USER_PROCESS or DEAD_PROCESS.


pid_t ut_pid
The process ID number of the login process.


char ut_line[]
The device name of the tty (without /dev/).


char ut_id[]
The inittab ID of the process.


char ut_user[]
The user’s login name.


struct timeval ut_tv
Time the entry was made.  For entries of type OLD_TIME this is
the time when the system clock changed, and for entries of type
NEW_TIME this is the time the system clock was set to.


In the GNU C Library, struct utmpx is identical to struct
utmp except for the fact that including utmpx.h does not make
visible the declaration of struct exit_status.
