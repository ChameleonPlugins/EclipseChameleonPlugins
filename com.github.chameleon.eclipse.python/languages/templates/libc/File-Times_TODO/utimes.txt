This function sets the file access and modification times of the file
filename.  The new file access time is specified by
tvp[0], and the new modification time by
tvp[1].  Similar to utime, if tvp is a null
pointer then the access and modification times of the file are set to
the current time.  This function comes from BSD.

The return values and error conditions are the same as for the utime
function.
