This function is like utimes, except that it does not follow
symbolic links.  If filename is the name of a symbolic link,
lutimes sets the file access and modification times of the
symbolic link special file itself (as seen by lstat;
see Symbolic Links) while utimes sets the file access and
modification times of the file the symbolic link refers to.  This
function comes from FreeBSD, and is not available on all platforms (if
not available, it will fail with ENOSYS).

The return values and error conditions are the same as for the utime
function.
