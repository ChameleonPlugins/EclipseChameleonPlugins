This function is used to modify the file times associated with the file
named filename.

If times is a null pointer, then the access and modification times
of the file are set to the current time.  Otherwise, they are set to the
values from the actime and modtime members (respectively)
of the utimbuf structure pointed to by times.

The attribute modification time for the file is set to the current time
in either case (since changing the time stamps is itself a modification
of the file attributes).

The utime function returns 0 if successful and -1
on failure.  In addition to the usual file name errors
(see File Name Errors), the following errno error conditions
are defined for this function:


EACCES
There is a permission problem in the case where a null pointer was
passed as the times argument.  In order to update the time stamp on
the file, you must either be the owner of the file, have write
permission for the file, or be a privileged user.


ENOENT
The file doesn’t exist.


EPERM
If the times argument is not a null pointer, you must either be
the owner of the file or be a privileged user.


EROFS
The file lives on a read-only file system.
