The asctime function converts the broken-down time value that
brokentime points to into a string in a standard format:


&quot;Tue May 21 13:46:22 1991\n&quot;


The abbreviations for the days of week are: ‘Sun’, ‘Mon’,
‘Tue’, ‘Wed’, ‘Thu’, ‘Fri’, and ‘Sat’.

The abbreviations for the months are: ‘Jan’, ‘Feb’,
‘Mar’, ‘Apr’, ‘May’, ‘Jun’, ‘Jul’, ‘Aug’,
‘Sep’, ‘Oct’, ‘Nov’, and ‘Dec’.

The return value points to a statically allocated string, which might be
overwritten by subsequent calls to asctime or ctime.
(But no other library function overwrites the contents of this
string.)
