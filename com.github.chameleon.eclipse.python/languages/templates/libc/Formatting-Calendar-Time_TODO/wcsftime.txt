The wcsftime function is equivalent to the strftime
function with the difference that it operates on wide character
strings.  The buffer where the result is stored, pointed to by s,
must be an array of wide characters.  The parameter size which
specifies the size of the output buffer gives the number of wide
character, not the number of bytes.

Also the format string template is a wide character string.  Since
all characters needed to specify the format string are in the basic
character set it is portably possible to write format strings in the C
source code using the L&quot;…&quot; notation.  The parameter
brokentime has the same meaning as in the strftime call.

The wcsftime function supports the same flags, modifiers, and
format specifiers as the strftime function.

The return value of wcsftime is the number of wide characters
stored in s.  When more characters would have to be written than
can be placed in the buffer s the return value is zero, with the
same problems indicated in the strftime documentation.
