The ctime function is similar to asctime, except that you
specify the calendar time argument as a time_t simple time value
rather than in broken-down local time format.  It is equivalent to


asctime (localtime (time))


Calling ctime also sets the current time zone as if
tzset were called.  See Time Zone Functions.
