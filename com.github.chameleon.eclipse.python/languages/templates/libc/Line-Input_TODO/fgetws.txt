The fgetws function reads wide characters from the stream
stream up to and including a newline character and stores them in
the string ws, adding a null wide character to mark the end of the
string.  You must supply count wide characters worth of space in
ws, but the number of characters read is at most count
- 1.  The extra character space is used to hold the null wide
character at the end of the string.

If the system is already at end of file when you call fgetws, then
the contents of the array ws are unchanged and a null pointer is
returned.  A null pointer is also returned if a read error occurs.
Otherwise, the return value is the pointer ws.

Warning: If the input data has a null wide character (which are
null bytes in the input stream), you can’t tell.  So don’t use
fgetws unless you know the data cannot contain a null.  Don’t use
it to read files edited by the user because, if the user inserts a null
character, you should either handle it properly or print a clear error
message.
