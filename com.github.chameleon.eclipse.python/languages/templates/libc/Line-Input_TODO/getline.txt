This function reads an entire line from stream, storing the text
(including the newline and a terminating null character) in a buffer
and storing the buffer address in *lineptr.

Before calling getline, you should place in *lineptr
the address of a buffer *n bytes long, allocated with
malloc.  If this buffer is long enough to hold the line,
getline stores the line in this buffer.  Otherwise,
getline makes the buffer bigger using realloc, storing the
new buffer address back in *lineptr and the increased size
back in *n.
See Unconstrained Allocation.

If you set *lineptr to a null pointer, and *n
to zero, before the call, then getline allocates the initial
buffer for you by calling malloc.  This buffer remains allocated
even if getline encounters errors and is unable to read any bytes.

In either case, when getline returns,  *lineptr is
a char * which points to the text of the line.

When getline is successful, it returns the number of characters
read (including the newline, but not including the terminating null).
This value enables you to distinguish null characters that are part of
the line from the null character inserted as a terminator.

This function is a GNU extension, but it is the recommended way to read
lines from a stream.  The alternative standard functions are unreliable.

If an error occurs or end of file is reached without any bytes read,
getline returns -1.
