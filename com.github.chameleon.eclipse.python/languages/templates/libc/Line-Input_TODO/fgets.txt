The fgets function reads characters from the stream stream
up to and including a newline character and stores them in the string
s, adding a null character to mark the end of the string.  You
must supply count characters worth of space in s, but the
number of characters read is at most count - 1.  The extra
character space is used to hold the null character at the end of the
string.

If the system is already at end of file when you call fgets, then
the contents of the array s are unchanged and a null pointer is
returned.  A null pointer is also returned if a read error occurs.
Otherwise, the return value is the pointer s.

Warning:  If the input data has a null character, you can’t tell.
So don’t use fgets unless you know the data cannot contain a null.
Don’t use it to read files edited by the user because, if the user inserts
a null character, you should either handle it properly or print a clear
error message.  We recommend using getline instead of fgets.
