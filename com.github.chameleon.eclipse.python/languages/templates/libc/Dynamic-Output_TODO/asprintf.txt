This function is similar to sprintf, except that it dynamically
allocates a string (as with malloc; see Unconstrained Allocation) to hold the output, instead of putting the output in a
buffer you allocate in advance.  The ptr argument should be the
address of a char * object, and a successful call to
asprintf stores a pointer to the newly allocated string at that
location.

The return value is the number of characters allocated for the buffer, or
less than zero if an error occurred.  Usually this means that the buffer
could not be allocated.

Here is how to use asprintf to get the same result as the
snprintf example, but more easily:


/* Construct a message describing the value of a variable
   whose name is name and whose value is value. */
char *
make_message (char *name, char *value)
{
  char *result;
  if (asprintf (&amp;result, &quot;value of %s is %s&quot;, name, value) &lt; 0)
    return NULL;
  return result;
}
