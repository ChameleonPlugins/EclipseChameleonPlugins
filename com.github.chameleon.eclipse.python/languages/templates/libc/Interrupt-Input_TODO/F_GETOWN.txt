This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to
specify that it should get information about the process or process
group to which SIGIO signals are sent.  (For a terminal, this is
actually the foreground process group ID, which you can get using
tcgetpgrp; see Terminal Access Functions.)

The return value is interpreted as a process ID; if negative, its
absolute value is the process group ID.

The following errno error condition is defined for this command:


EBADF
The filedes argument is invalid.
