Macro: int F_SETOWN
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to
specify that it should set the process or process group to which
SIGIO signals are sent.  This command requires a third argument
of type pid_t to be passed to fcntl, so that the form of
the call is:


fcntl (filedes, F_SETOWN, pid)


The pid argument should be a process ID.  You can also pass a
negative number whose absolute value is a process group ID.

The return value from fcntl with this command is -1
in case of error and some other value if successful.  The following
errno error conditions are defined for this command:


EBADF
The filedes argument is invalid.


ESRCH
There is no process or process group corresponding to pid.
