Macro: int F_OFD_GETLK
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to
specify that it should get information about a lock.  This command
requires a third argument of type struct flock * to be passed
to fcntl, so that the form of the call is:


fcntl (filedes, F_OFD_GETLK, lockp)


If there is a lock already in place that would block the lock described
by the lockp argument, information about that lock is written to
*lockp.  Existing locks are not reported if they are
compatible with making a new lock as specified.  Thus, you should
specify a lock type of F_WRLCK if you want to find out about both
read and write locks, or F_RDLCK if you want to find out about
write locks only.

There might be more than one lock affecting the region specified by the
lockp argument, but fcntl only returns information about
one of them. Which lock is returned in this situation is undefined.

The l_whence member of the lockp structure are set to
SEEK_SET and the l_start and l_len fields are set
to identify the locked region.

If no conflicting lock exists, the only change to the lockp structure
is to update the l_type field to the value F_UNLCK.

The normal return value from fcntl with this command is either 0
on success or -1, which indicates an error. The following errno
error conditions are defined for this command:


EBADF
The filedes argument is invalid.


EINVAL
Either the lockp argument doesn’t specify valid lock information,
the operating system kernel doesn’t support open file description locks, or the file
associated with filedes doesn’t support locks.
