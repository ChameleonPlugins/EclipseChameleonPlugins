Macro: int F_OFD_SETLKW
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to
specify that it should set or clear a lock.  It is just like the
F_OFD_SETLK command, but causes the process to wait until the request
can be completed.

This command requires a third argument of type struct flock *, as
for the F_OFD_SETLK command.

The fcntl return values and errors are the same as for the
F_OFD_SETLK command, but these additional errno error conditions
are defined for this command:


EINTR
The function was interrupted by a signal while it was waiting.
