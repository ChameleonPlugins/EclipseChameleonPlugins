An expression representing a particular very large number.  On machines
that use IEEE 754 floating point format, HUGE_VAL is infinity.
On other machines, it’s typically the largest positive number that can
be represented.

Mathematical functions return the appropriately typed version of
HUGE_VAL or -HUGE_VAL when the result is too large
to be represented.
