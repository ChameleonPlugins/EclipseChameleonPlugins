The fwide function can be used to set and query the state of the
orientation of the stream stream.  If the mode parameter has
a positive value the streams get wide oriented, for negative values
narrow oriented.  It is not possible to overwrite previous orientations
with fwide.  I.e., if the stream stream was already
oriented before the call nothing is done.

If mode is zero the current orientation state is queried and
nothing is changed.

The fwide function returns a negative value, zero, or a positive
value if the stream is narrow, not at all, or wide oriented
respectively.

This function was introduced in Amendment 1 to ISO C90 and is
declared in wchar.h.
