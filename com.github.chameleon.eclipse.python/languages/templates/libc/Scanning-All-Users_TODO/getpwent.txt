The getpwent function reads the next entry from the stream
initialized by setpwent.  It returns a pointer to the entry.  The
structure is statically allocated and is rewritten on subsequent calls
to getpwent.  You must copy the contents of the structure if you
wish to save the information.

A null pointer is returned when no more entries are available.
