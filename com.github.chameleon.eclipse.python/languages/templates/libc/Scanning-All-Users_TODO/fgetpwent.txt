This function reads the next user entry from stream and returns a
pointer to the entry.  The structure is statically allocated and is
rewritten on subsequent calls to fgetpwent.  You must copy the
contents of the structure if you wish to save the information.

The stream must correspond to a file in the same format as the standard
password database file.
