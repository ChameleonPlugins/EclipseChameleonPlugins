Function: int getpwnam_r (const char *name, struct passwd *result_buf, char *buffer, size_t buflen, struct passwd **result)

| AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem
| See POSIX Safety Concepts.



This function is similar to getpwnam in that is returns
information about the user whose user name is name.  However, like
getpwuid_r, it fills the user supplied buffers in
result_buf and buffer with the information instead of using
a static buffer.

The return values are the same as for getpwuid_r.
