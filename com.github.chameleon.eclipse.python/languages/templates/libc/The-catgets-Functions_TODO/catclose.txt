The catclose function can be used to free the resources
associated with a message catalog which previously was opened by a call
to catopen.  If the resources can be successfully freed the
function returns 0.  Otherwise it return -1 and the
global variable errno is set.  Errors can occur if the catalog
descriptor catalog_desc is not valid in which case errno is
set to EBADF.
