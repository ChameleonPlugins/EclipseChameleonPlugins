The function catgets has to be used to access the massage catalog
previously opened using the catopen function.  The
catalog_desc parameter must be a value previously returned by
catopen.

The next two parameters, set and message, reflect the
internal organization of the message catalog files.  This will be
explained in detail below.  For now it is interesting to know that a
catalog can consists of several set and the messages in each thread are
individually numbered using numbers.  Neither the set number nor the
message number must be consecutive.  They can be arbitrarily chosen.
But each message (unless equal to another one) must have its own unique
pair of set and message number.

Since it is not guaranteed that the message catalog for the language
selected by the user exists the last parameter string helps to
handle this case gracefully.  If no matching string can be found
string is returned.  This means for the programmer that


 the string parameters should contain reasonable text (this also
helps to understand the program seems otherwise there would be no hint
on the string which is expected to be returned.
 all string arguments should be written in the same language.
