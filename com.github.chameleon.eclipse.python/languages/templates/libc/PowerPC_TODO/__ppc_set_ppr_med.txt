Set the Program Priority Register to medium value (default).

The Program Priority Register (PPR) is a 64-bit register that controls
the program’s priority.  By adjusting the PPR value the programmer may
improve system throughput by causing the system resources to be used
more efficiently, especially in contention situations.
The three unprivileged states available are covered by the functions
__ppc_set_ppr_med (medium – default), __ppc_set_ppc_low (low)
and __ppc_set_ppc_med_low (medium low).  More information
available in Power ISA 2.06b - Book II - Section 3.1.
