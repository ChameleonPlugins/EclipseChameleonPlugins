Read the current value of the Time Base Register.

The Time Base Register is a 64-bit register that stores a monotonically
incremented value updated at a system-dependent frequency that may be
different from the processor frequency.  More information is available in
Power ISA 2.06b - Book II - Section 5.2.

__ppc_get_timebase uses the processor’s time base facility directly
without requiring assistance from the operating system, so it is very
efficient.
