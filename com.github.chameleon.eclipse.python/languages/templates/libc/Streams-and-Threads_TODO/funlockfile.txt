The funlockfile function releases the internal locking object of
the stream stream.  The stream must have been locked before by a
call to flockfile or a successful call of ftrylockfile.
The implicit locking performed by the stream operations do not count.
The funlockfile function does not return an error status and the
behavior of a call for a stream which is not locked by the current
thread is undefined.
