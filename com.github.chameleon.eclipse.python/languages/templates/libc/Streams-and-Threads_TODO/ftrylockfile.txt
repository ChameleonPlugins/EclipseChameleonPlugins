The ftrylockfile function tries to acquire the internal locking
object associated with the stream stream just like
flockfile.  But unlike flockfile this function does not
block if the lock is not available.  ftrylockfile returns zero if
the lock was successfully acquired.  Otherwise the stream is locked by
another thread.
