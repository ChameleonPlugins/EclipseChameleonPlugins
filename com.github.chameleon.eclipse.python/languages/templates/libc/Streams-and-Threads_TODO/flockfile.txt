The flockfile function acquires the internal locking object
associated with the stream stream.  This ensures that no other
thread can explicitly through flockfile/ftrylockfile or
implicit through a call of a stream function lock the stream.  The
thread will block until the lock is acquired.  An explicit call to
funlockfile has to be used to release the lock.
