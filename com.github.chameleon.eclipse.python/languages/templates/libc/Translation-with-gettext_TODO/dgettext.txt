The dgettext functions acts just like the gettext
function.  It only takes an additional first argument domainname
which guides the selection of the message catalogs which are searched
for the translation.  If the domainname parameter is the null
pointer the dgettext function is exactly equivalent to
gettext since the default value for the domain name is used.

As for gettext the return value type is char * which is an
anachronism.  The returned string must never be modified.
