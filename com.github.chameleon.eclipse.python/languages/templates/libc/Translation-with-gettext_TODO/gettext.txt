The gettext function searches the currently selected message
catalogs for a string which is equal to msgid.  If there is such a
string available it is returned.  Otherwise the argument string
msgid is returned.

Please note that although the return value is char * the
returned string must not be changed.  This broken type results from the
history of the function and does not reflect the way the function should
be used.

Please note that above we wrote “message catalogs” (plural).  This is
a specialty of the GNU implementation of these functions and we will
say more about this when we talk about the ways message catalogs are
selected (see Locating gettext catalog).

The gettext function does not modify the value of the global
errno variable.  This is necessary to make it possible to write
something like


  printf (gettext (&quot;Operation failed: %m\n&quot;));


Here the errno value is used in the printf function while
processing the %m format element and if the gettext
function would change this value (it is called before printf is
called) we would get a wrong message.

So there is no easy way to detect a missing message catalog beside
comparing the argument string with the result.  But it is normally the
task of the user to react on missing catalogs.  The program cannot guess
when a message catalog is really necessary since for a user who speaks
the language the program was developed in does not need any translation.
