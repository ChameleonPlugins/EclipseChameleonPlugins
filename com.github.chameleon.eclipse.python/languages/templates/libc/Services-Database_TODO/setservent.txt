This function opens the services database to begin scanning it.

If the stayopen argument is nonzero, this sets a flag so that
subsequent calls to getservbyname or getservbyport will
not close the database (as they usually would).  This makes for more
efficiency if you call those functions several times, by avoiding
reopening the database for each call.
