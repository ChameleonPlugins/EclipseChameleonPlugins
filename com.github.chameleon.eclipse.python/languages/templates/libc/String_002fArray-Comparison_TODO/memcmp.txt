The function memcmp compares the size bytes of memory
beginning at a1 against the size bytes of memory beginning
at a2.  The value returned has the same sign as the difference
between the first differing pair of bytes (interpreted as unsigned
char objects, then promoted to int).

If the contents of the two blocks are equal, memcmp returns
0.
