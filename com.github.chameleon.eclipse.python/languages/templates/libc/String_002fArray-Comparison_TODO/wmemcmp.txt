The function wmemcmp compares the size wide characters
beginning at a1 against the size wide characters beginning
at a2.  The value returned is smaller than or larger than zero
depending on whether the first differing wide character is a1 is
smaller or larger than the corresponding character in a2.

If the contents of the two blocks are equal, wmemcmp returns
0.
