This function is like wcscmp, except that differences in case are
ignored.  How uppercase and lowercase characters are related is
determined by the currently selected locale.  In the standard &quot;C&quot;
locale the characters Ä and ä do not match but in a locale which
regards these characters as parts of the alphabet they do match.

wcscasecmp is a GNU extension.
