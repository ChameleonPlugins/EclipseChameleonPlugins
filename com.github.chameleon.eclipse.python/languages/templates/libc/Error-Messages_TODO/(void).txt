If the error_print_progname variable is defined to a non-zero
value the function pointed to is called by error or
error_at_line.  It is expected to print the program name or do
something similarly useful.

The function is expected to be print to the stderr stream and
must be able to handle whatever orientation the stream has.

The variable is global and shared by all threads.
