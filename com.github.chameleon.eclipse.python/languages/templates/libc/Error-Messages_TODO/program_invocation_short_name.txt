Variable: char * program_invocation_short_name
This variable’s value is the name that was used to invoke the program
running in the current process, with directory names removed.  (That is
to say, it is the same as program_invocation_name minus
everything up to the last slash, if any.)

This variable is a GNU extension and is declared in errno.h.
