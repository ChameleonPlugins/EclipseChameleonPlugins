Data Type: iconv_t
This data type is an abstract type defined in iconv.h.  The user
must not assume anything about the definition of this type; it must be
completely opaque.

Objects of this type can get assigned handles for the conversions using
the iconv functions.  The objects themselves need not be freed, but
the conversions for which the handles stand for have to.
