This function causes all open streams of the process to be closed and
the connection to corresponding files to be broken.  All buffered data
is written and any buffered input is discarded.  The fcloseall
function returns a value of 0 if all the files were closed
successfully, and EOF if an error was detected.

This function should be used only in special situations, e.g., when an
error occurred and the program must be aborted.  Normally each single
stream should be closed separately so that problems with individual
streams can be identified.  It is also problematic since the standard
streams (see Standard Streams) will also be closed.

The function fcloseall is declared in stdio.h.
