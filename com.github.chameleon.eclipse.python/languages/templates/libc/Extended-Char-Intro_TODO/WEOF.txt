Macro: wint_t WEOF
The macro WEOF evaluates to a constant expression of type
wint_t whose value is different from any member of the extended
character set.

WEOF need not be the same value as EOF and unlike
EOF it also need not be negative.  In other words, sloppy
code like


{
  int c;
  …
  while ((c = getc (fp)) &lt; 0)
    …
}


has to be rewritten to use WEOF explicitly when wide characters
are used:


{
  wint_t c;
  …
  while ((c = wgetc (fp)) != WEOF)
    …
}



This macro was introduced in Amendment 1 to ISO C90 and is
defined in wchar.h.
