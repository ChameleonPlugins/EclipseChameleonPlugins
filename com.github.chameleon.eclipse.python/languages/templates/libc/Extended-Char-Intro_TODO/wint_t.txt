Data type: wint_t
wint_t is a data type used for parameters and variables that
contain a single wide character.  As the name suggests this type is the
equivalent of int when using the normal char strings.  The
types wchar_t and wint_t often have the same
representation if their size is 32 bits wide but if wchar_t is
defined as char the type wint_t must be defined as
int due to the parameter promotion.


This type is defined in wchar.h and was introduced in
Amendment 1 to ISO C90.
