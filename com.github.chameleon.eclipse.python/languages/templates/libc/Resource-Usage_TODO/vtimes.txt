vtimes reports resource usage totals for a process.

If current is non-null, vtimes stores resource usage totals for
the invoking process alone in the structure to which it points.  If
child is non-null, vtimes stores resource usage totals for all
past children (which have terminated) of the invoking process in the structure
to which it points.


Data Type: struct vtimes
This data type contains information about the resource usage of a process.
Each member corresponds to a member of the struct rusage data type
described above.


vm_utime
User CPU time.  Analogous to ru_utime in struct rusage

vm_stime
System CPU time.  Analogous to ru_stime in struct rusage

vm_idsrss
Data and stack memory.  The sum of the values that would be reported as
ru_idrss and ru_isrss in struct rusage

vm_ixrss
Shared memory.  Analogous to ru_ixrss in struct rusage

vm_maxrss
Maximent resident set size.  Analogous to ru_maxrss in
struct rusage

vm_majflt
Major page faults.  Analogous to ru_majflt in struct rusage

vm_minflt
Minor page faults.  Analogous to ru_minflt in struct rusage

vm_nswap
Swap count.  Analogous to ru_nswap in struct rusage

vm_inblk
Disk reads.  Analogous to ru_inblk in struct rusage

vm_oublk
Disk writes.  Analogous to ru_oublk in struct rusage





The return value is zero if the function succeeds; -1 otherwise.
