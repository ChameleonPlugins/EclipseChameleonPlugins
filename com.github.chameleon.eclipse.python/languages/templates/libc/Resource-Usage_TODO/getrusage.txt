This function reports resource usage totals for processes specified by
processes, storing the information in *rusage.

In most systems, processes has only two valid values:


RUSAGE_SELF
Just the current process.


RUSAGE_CHILDREN
All child processes (direct and indirect) that have already terminated.



The return value of getrusage is zero for success, and -1
for failure.


EINVAL
The argument processes is not valid.
