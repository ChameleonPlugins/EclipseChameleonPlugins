The bindtextdomain function can be used to specify the directory
which contains the message catalogs for domain domainname for the
different languages.  To be correct, this is the directory where the
hierarchy of directories is expected.  Details are explained below.

For the programmer it is important to note that the translations which
come with the program have be placed in a directory hierarchy starting
at, say, /foo/bar.  Then the program should make a
bindtextdomain call to bind the domain for the current program to
this directory.  So it is made sure the catalogs are found.  A correctly
running program does not depend on the user setting an environment
variable.

The bindtextdomain function can be used several times and if the
domainname argument is different the previously bound domains
will not be overwritten.

If the program which wish to use bindtextdomain at some point of
time use the chdir function to change the current working
directory it is important that the dirname strings ought to be an
absolute pathname.  Otherwise the addressed directory might vary with
the time.

If the dirname parameter is the null pointer bindtextdomain
returns the currently selected directory for the domain with the name
domainname.

The bindtextdomain function returns a pointer to a string
containing the name of the selected directory name.  The string is
allocated internally in the function and must not be changed by the
user.  If the system went out of core during the execution of
bindtextdomain the return value is NULL and the global
variable errno is set accordingly.
