The textdomain function sets the default domain, which is used in
all future gettext calls, to domainname.  Please note that
dgettext and dcgettext calls are not influenced if the
domainname parameter of these functions is not the null pointer.

Before the first call to textdomain the default domain is
messages.  This is the name specified in the specification of
the gettext API.  This name is as good as any other name.  No
program should ever really use a domain with this name since this can
only lead to problems.

The function returns the value which is from now on taken as the default
domain.  If the system went out of memory the returned value is
NULL and the global variable errno is set to ENOMEM.
Despite the return value type being char * the return string must
not be changed.  It is allocated internally by the textdomain
function.

If the domainname parameter is the null pointer no new default
domain is set.  Instead the currently selected default domain is
returned.

If the domainname parameter is the empty string the default domain
is reset to its initial value, the domain with the name messages.
This possibility is questionable to use since the domain messages
really never should be used.
