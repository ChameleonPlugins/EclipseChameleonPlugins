The tcflow function is used to perform operations relating to
XON/XOFF flow control on the terminal file specified by filedes.

The action argument specifies what operation to perform, and can
be one of the following values:




TCOOFF
Suspend transmission of output.



TCOON
Restart transmission of output.



TCIOFF
Transmit a STOP character.

For more information about the STOP and START characters, see Special Characters.

The return value is normally zero.  In the event of an error, a value
of -1 is returned.  The following errno error conditions
are defined for this function:




EBADF
The filedes is not a valid file descriptor.



ENOTTY
The filedes is not associated with a terminal device.
