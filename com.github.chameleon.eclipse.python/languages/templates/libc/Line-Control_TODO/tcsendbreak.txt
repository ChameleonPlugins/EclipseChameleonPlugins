This function generates a break condition by transmitting a stream of
zero bits on the terminal associated with the file descriptor
filedes.  The duration of the break is controlled by the
duration argument.  If zero, the duration is between 0.25 and 0.5
seconds.  The meaning of a nonzero value depends on the operating system.

This function does nothing if the terminal is not an asynchronous serial
data port.

The return value is normally zero.  In the event of an error, a value
of -1 is returned.  The following errno error conditions
are defined for this function:


EBADF
The filedes is not a valid file descriptor.


ENOTTY
The filedes is not associated with a terminal device.
