This flag is meaningful only for the SIGCHLD signal.  When the
flag is set, the system delivers the signal for a terminated child
process but not for one that is stopped.  By default, SIGCHLD is
delivered for both terminated children and stopped children.

Setting this flag for a signal other than SIGCHLD has no effect.
