stime sets the system clock, i.e., it tells the system that the
current calendar time is newtime, where newtime is
interpreted as described in the above definition of time_t.

settimeofday is a newer function which sets the system clock to
better than one second precision.  settimeofday is generally a
better choice than stime.  See High-Resolution Calendar.

Only the superuser can set the system clock.

If the function succeeds, the return value is zero.  Otherwise, it is
-1 and errno is set accordingly:


EPERM
The process is not superuser.
