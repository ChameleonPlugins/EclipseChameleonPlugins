Data Type: time_t
This is the data type used to represent simple time.  Sometimes, it also
represents an elapsed time.  When interpreted as a calendar time value,
it represents the number of seconds elapsed since 00:00:00 on January 1,
1970, Coordinated Universal Time.  (This calendar time is sometimes
referred to as the epoch.)  POSIX requires that this count not
include leap seconds, but on some systems this count includes leap seconds
if you set TZ to certain values (see TZ Variable).

Note that a simple time has no concept of local time zone.  Calendar
Time T is the same instant in time regardless of where on the
globe the computer is.

In the GNU C Library, time_t is equivalent to long int.
In other systems, time_t might be either an integer or
floating-point type.
