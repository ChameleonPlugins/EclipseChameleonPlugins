This function is used to inquire about runtime system parameters.  The
parameter argument should be one of the ‘_SC_’ symbols listed
below.

The normal return value from sysconf is the value you requested.
A value of -1 is returned both if the implementation does not
impose a limit, and in case of an error.

The following errno error conditions are defined for this function:


EINVAL
The value of the parameter is invalid.
