The sigstack function specifies an alternate stack for use during
signal handling.  When a signal is received by the process and its
action indicates that the signal stack is used, the system arranges a
switch to the currently installed signal stack while the handler for
that signal is executed.

If oldstack is not a null pointer, information about the currently
installed signal stack is returned in the location it points to.  If
stack is not a null pointer, then this is installed as the new
stack for use by signal handlers.

The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure.
