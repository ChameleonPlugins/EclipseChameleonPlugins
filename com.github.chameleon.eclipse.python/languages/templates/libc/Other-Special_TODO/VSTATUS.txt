This is the subscript for the STATUS character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VSTATUS] holds the character
itself.

The STATUS character’s effect is to print out a status message about how
the current process is running.

The STATUS character is recognized only in canonical mode, and only if
NOKERNINFO is not set.

This character is available only on BSD systems and GNU/Hurd systems.
