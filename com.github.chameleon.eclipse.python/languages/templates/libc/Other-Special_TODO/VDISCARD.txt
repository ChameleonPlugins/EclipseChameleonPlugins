This is the subscript for the DISCARD character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VDISCARD] holds the character
itself.

The DISCARD character is recognized only when IEXTEN is set, but
in both canonical and noncanonical mode.  Its effect is to toggle the
discard-output flag.  When this flag is set, all program output is
discarded.  Setting the flag also discards all output currently in the
output buffer.  Typing any other character resets the flag.

This character is available on BSD systems and GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd systems.
