The value of NL_ARGMAX is the maximum value allowed for the
specification of a positional parameter in a printf call.  The
actual value in effect at runtime can be retrieved by using
sysconf using the _SC_NL_ARGMAX parameter see Sysconf Definition.

Some system have a quite low limit such as 9 for System V
systems.  The GNU C Library has no real limit.
