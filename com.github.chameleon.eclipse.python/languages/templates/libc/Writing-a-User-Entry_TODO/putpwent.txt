This function writes the user entry *p to the stream
stream, in the format used for the standard user database
file.  The return value is zero on success and nonzero on failure.

This function exists for compatibility with SVID.  We recommend that you
avoid using it, because it makes sense only on the assumption that the
struct passwd structure has no members except the standard ones;
on a system which merges the traditional Unix data base with other
extended information about users, adding an entry using this function
would inevitably leave out much of the important information.

The group and user ID fields are left empty if the group or user name
starts with a - or +.

The function putpwent is declared in pwd.h.
