The cuserid function returns a pointer to a string containing a
user name associated with the effective ID of the process.  If
string is not a null pointer, it should be an array that can hold
at least L_cuserid characters; the string is returned in this
array.  Otherwise, a pointer to a string in a static area is returned.
This string is statically allocated and might be overwritten on
subsequent calls to this function or to getlogin.

The use of this function is deprecated since it is marked to be
withdrawn in XPG4.2 and has already been removed from newer revisions of
POSIX.1.
