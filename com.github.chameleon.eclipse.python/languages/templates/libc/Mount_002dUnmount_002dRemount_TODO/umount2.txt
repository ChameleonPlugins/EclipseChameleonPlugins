umount2 unmounts a filesystem.

You can identify the filesystem to unmount either by the device special
file that contains the filesystem or by the mount point.  The effect is
the same.  Specify either as the string file.

flags contains the one-bit field identified by the following
mask macro:


MNT_FORCE
This bit on means to force the unmounting even if the filesystem is
busy, by making it unbusy first.  If the bit is off and the filesystem is
busy, umount2 fails with errno = EBUSY.  Depending
on the filesystem, this may override all, some, or no busy conditions.




All other bits in flags should be set to zero; otherwise, the result
is undefined.

Example:


#include &lt;sys/mount.h&gt;

umount2(&quot;/mnt&quot;, MNT_FORCE);

umount2(&quot;/dev/hdd1&quot;, 0);



After the filesystem is unmounted, the directory that was the mount point
is visible, as are any files in it.

As part of unmounting, umount2 syncs the filesystem.

If the unmounting is successful, the return value is zero.  Otherwise, it
is -1 and errno is set accordingly:


EPERM
The process is not superuser.

EBUSY
The filesystem cannot be unmounted because it is busy.  E.g. it contains
a directory that is some process’s working directory or a file that some
process has open.  With some filesystems in some cases, you can avoid
this failure with the MNT_FORCE option.


EINVAL
file validly refers to a file, but that file is neither a mount
point nor a device special file of a currently mounted filesystem.
