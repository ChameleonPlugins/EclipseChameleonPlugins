The wctrans function has to be used to find out whether a named
mapping is defined in the current locale selected for the
LC_CTYPE category.  If the returned value is non-zero, you can use
it afterwards in calls to towctrans.  If the return value is
zero no such mapping is known in the current locale.

Beside locale-specific mappings there are two mappings which are
guaranteed to be available in every locale:


&quot;tolower&quot;&quot;toupper&quot;



These functions are declared in wctype.h.
