This is just like pathconf except that an open file descriptor
is used to specify the file for which information is requested, instead
of a file name.

The following errno error conditions are defined for this function:


EBADF
The filedes argument is not a valid file descriptor.


EINVAL
The value of parameter is invalid, or the implementation doesn’t
support the parameter for the specific file.
