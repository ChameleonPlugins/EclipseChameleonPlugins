This function allocates and opens a pseudo-terminal pair, returning the
file descriptor for the master in *amaster, and the file
descriptor for the slave in *aslave.  If the argument name
is not a null pointer, the file name of the slave pseudo-terminal
device is stored in *name.  If termp is not a null pointer,
the terminal attributes of the slave are set to the ones specified in
the structure that termp points to (see Terminal Modes).
Likewise, if the winp is not a null pointer, the screen size of
the slave is set to the values specified in the structure that
winp points to.

The normal return value from openpty is 0; a value of
-1 is returned in case of failure.  The following errno
conditions are defined for this function:


ENOENT
There are no free pseudo-terminal pairs available.



Warning: Using the openpty function with name not
set to NULL is very dangerous because it provides no
protection against overflowing the string name.  You should use
the ttyname function on the file descriptor returned in
*slave to find out the file name of the slave pseudo-terminal
device instead.
