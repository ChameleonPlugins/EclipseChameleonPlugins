The wcschr function finds the first occurrence of the wide
character wc in the null-terminated wide character string
beginning at wstring.  The return value is a pointer to the
located wide character, or a null pointer if no match was found.

The terminating null character is considered to be part of the wide
character string, so you can use this function get a pointer to the end
of a wide character string by specifying a null wude character as the
value of the wc argument.  It would be better (but less portable)
to use wcschrnul in this case, though.
