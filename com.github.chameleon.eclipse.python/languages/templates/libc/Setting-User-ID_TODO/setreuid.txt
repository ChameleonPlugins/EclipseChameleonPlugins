This function sets the real user ID of the process to ruid and the
effective user ID to euid.  If ruid is -1, it means
not to change the real user ID; likewise if euid is -1, it
means not to change the effective user ID.

The setreuid function exists for compatibility with 4.3 BSD Unix,
which does not support file IDs.  You can use this function to swap the
effective and real user IDs of the process.  (Privileged processes are
not limited to this particular usage.)  If file IDs are supported, you
should use that feature instead of this function.  See Enable/Disable Setuid.

The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure.
The following errno error conditions are defined for this
function:


EPERM
The process does not have the appropriate privileges; you do not
have permission to change to the specified ID.
