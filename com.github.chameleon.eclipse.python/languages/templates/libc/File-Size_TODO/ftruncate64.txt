This function is similar to the ftruncate function.  The
difference is that the length argument is 64 bits wide even on 32
bits machines which allows the handling of files with sizes up to
2^63 bytes.

When the source file is compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 on a
32 bits machine this function is actually available under the name
ftruncate and so transparently replaces the 32 bits interface.
