The function ecb_crypt encrypts or decrypts one or more blocks
using DES.  Each block is encrypted independently.

The blocks and the key are stored packed in 8-bit bytes, so
that the first bit of the key is the most-significant bit of
key[0] and the 63rd bit of the key is stored as the
least-significant bit of key[7].  The key should have the
correct parity.

len is the number of bytes in blocks.  It should be a
multiple of 8 (so that there is a whole number of blocks to encrypt).
len is limited to a maximum of DES_MAXDATA bytes.

The result of the encryption replaces the input in blocks.

The mode parameter is the bitwise OR of two of the following:


DES_ENCRYPT


This constant, used in the mode parameter, specifies that
blocks is to be encrypted.


DES_DECRYPT


This constant, used in the mode parameter, specifies that
blocks is to be decrypted.


DES_HW


This constant, used in the mode parameter, asks to use a hardware
device.  If no hardware device is available, encryption happens anyway,
but in software.


DES_SW


This constant, used in the mode parameter, specifies that no
hardware device is to be used.



The result of the function will be one of these values:


DESERR_NONE


The encryption succeeded.


DESERR_NOHWDEVICE


The encryption succeeded, but there was no hardware device available.


DESERR_HWERROR


The encryption failed because of a hardware problem.


DESERR_BADPARAM


The encryption failed because of a bad parameter, for instance len
is not a multiple of 8 or len is larger than DES_MAXDATA.
