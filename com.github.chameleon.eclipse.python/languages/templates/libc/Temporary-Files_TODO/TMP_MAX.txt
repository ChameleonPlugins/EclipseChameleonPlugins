Macro: int TMP_MAX
The macro TMP_MAX is a lower bound for how many temporary names
you can create with tmpnam.  You can rely on being able to call
tmpnam at least this many times before it might fail saying you
have made too many temporary file names.

With the GNU C Library, you can create a very large number of temporary
file names.  If you actually created the files, you would probably run
out of disk space before you ran out of names.  Some other systems have
a fixed, small limit on the number of temporary files.  The limit is
never less than 25.
