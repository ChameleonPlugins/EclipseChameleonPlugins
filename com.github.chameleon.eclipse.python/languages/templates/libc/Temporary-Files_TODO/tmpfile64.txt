This function is similar to tmpfile, but the stream it returns a
pointer to was opened using tmpfile64.  Therefore this stream can
be used for files larger than 2^31 bytes on 32-bit machines.

Please note that the return type is still FILE *.  There is no
special FILE type for the LFS interface.

If the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 on a 32
bits machine this function is available under the name tmpfile
and so transparently replaces the old interface.
