The mkstemp function generates a unique file name just as
mktemp does, but it also opens the file for you with open
(see Opening and Closing Files).  If successful, it modifies
template in place and returns a file descriptor for that file open
for reading and writing.  If mkstemp cannot create a
uniquely-named file, it returns -1.  If template does not
end with ‘XXXXXX’, mkstemp returns -1 and does not
modify template.

The file is opened using mode 0600.  If the file is meant to be
used by other users this mode must be changed explicitly.
