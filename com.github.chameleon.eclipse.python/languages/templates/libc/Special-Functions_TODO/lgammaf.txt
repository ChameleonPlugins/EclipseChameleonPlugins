lgamma returns the natural logarithm of the absolute value of
the gamma function of x.  The gamma function is defined as

gamma (x) = integral from 0 to &amp;infin; of t^(x-1) e^-t dt



The sign of the gamma function is stored in the global variable
signgam, which is declared in math.h.  It is 1 if
the intermediate result was positive or zero, or -1 if it was
negative.

To compute the real gamma function you can use the tgamma
function or you can compute the values as follows:

lgam = lgamma(x);
gam  = signgam*exp(lgam);


The gamma function has singularities at the non-positive integers.
lgamma will raise the zero divide exception if evaluated at a
singularity.
