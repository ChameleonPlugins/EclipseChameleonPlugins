Data Type: struct timezone
The struct timezone structure is used to hold minimal information
about the local time zone.  It has the following members:


int tz_minuteswest
This is the number of minutes west of UTC.


int tz_dsttime
If nonzero, Daylight Saving Time applies during some part of the year.



The struct timezone type is obsolete and should never be used.
Instead, use the facilities described in Time Zone Functions.
