The gettimeofday function returns the current calendar time as
the elapsed time since the epoch in the struct timeval structure
indicated by tp.  (see Elapsed Time for a description of
struct timeval).  Information about the time zone is returned in
the structure pointed at tzp.  If the tzp argument is a null
pointer, time zone information is ignored.

The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure.  The
following errno error condition is defined for this function:


ENOSYS
The operating system does not support getting time zone information, and
tzp is not a null pointer.  GNU systems do not
support using struct timezone to represent time zone
information; that is an obsolete feature of 4.3 BSD.
Instead, use the facilities described in Time Zone Functions.
