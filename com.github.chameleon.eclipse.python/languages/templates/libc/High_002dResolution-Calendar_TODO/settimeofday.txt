The settimeofday function sets the current calendar time in the
system clock according to the arguments.  As for gettimeofday,
the calendar time is represented as the elapsed time since the epoch.
As for gettimeofday, time zone information is ignored if
tzp is a null pointer.

You must be a privileged user in order to use settimeofday.

Some kernels automatically set the system clock from some source such as
a hardware clock when they start up.  Others, including Linux, place the
system clock in an “invalid” state (in which attempts to read the clock
fail).  A call of stime removes the system clock from an invalid
state, and system startup scripts typically run a program that calls
stime.

settimeofday causes a sudden jump forwards or backwards, which
can cause a variety of problems in a system.  Use adjtime (below)
to make a smooth transition from one time to another by temporarily
speeding up or slowing down the clock.

With a Linux kernel, adjtimex does the same thing and can also
make permanent changes to the speed of the system clock so it doesn’t
need to be corrected as often.

The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure.  The
following errno error conditions are defined for this function:


EPERM
This process cannot set the clock because it is not privileged.


ENOSYS
The operating system does not support setting time zone information, and
tzp is not a null pointer.
