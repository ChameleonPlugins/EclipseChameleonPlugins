This is like scanf, except that the characters are taken from the
null-terminated string s instead of from a stream.  Reaching the
end of the string is treated as an end-of-file condition.

The behavior of this function is undefined if copying takes place
between objects that overlap—for example, if s is also given
as an argument to receive a string read under control of the ‘%s’,
‘%S’, or ‘%[’ conversion.
