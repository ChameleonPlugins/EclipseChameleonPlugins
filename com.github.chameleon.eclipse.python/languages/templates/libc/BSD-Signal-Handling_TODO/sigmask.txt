This macro returns a signal mask that has the bit for signal signum
set.  You can bitwise-OR the results of several calls to sigmask
together to specify more than one signal.  For example,


(sigmask (SIGTSTP) | sigmask (SIGSTOP)
 | sigmask (SIGTTIN) | sigmask (SIGTTOU))


specifies a mask that includes all the job-control stop signals.
