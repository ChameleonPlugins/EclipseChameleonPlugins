The memalign function allocates a block of size bytes whose
address is a multiple of boundary.  The boundary must be a
power of two!  The function memalign works by allocating a
somewhat larger block, and then returning an address within the block
that is on the specified boundary.

The memalign function returns a null pointer on error and sets
errno to one of the following values:


ENOMEM
There was insufficient memory available to satisfy the request.


EINVAL
alignment is not a power of two.




The memalign function is obsolete and aligned_alloc or
posix_memalign should be used instead.
