The initstate function is used to initialize the random number
generator state.  The argument state is an array of size
bytes, used to hold the state information.  It is initialized based on
seed.  The size must be between 8 and 256 bytes, and should be a
power of two.  The bigger the state array, the better.

The return value is the previous value of the state information array.
You can use this value later as an argument to setstate to
restore that state.
