This function returns the next pseudo-random number in the sequence.
The value returned ranges from 0 to 2147483647.

NB: Temporarily this function was defined to return a
int32_t value to indicate that the return value always contains
32 bits even if long int is wider.  The standard demands it
differently.  Users must always be aware of the 32-bit limitation,
though.
