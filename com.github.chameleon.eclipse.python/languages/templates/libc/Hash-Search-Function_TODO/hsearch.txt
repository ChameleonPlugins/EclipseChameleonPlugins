To search in a hashing table created using hcreate the
hsearch function must be used.  This function can perform simple
search for an element (if action has the FIND) or it can
alternatively insert the key element into the hashing table.  Entries
are never replaced.

The key is denoted by a pointer to an object of type ENTRY.  For
locating the corresponding position in the hashing table only the
key element of the structure is used.

If an entry with matching key is found the action parameter is
irrelevant.  The found entry is returned.  If no matching entry is found
and the action parameter has the value FIND the function
returns a NULL pointer.  If no entry is found and the
action parameter has the value ENTER a new entry is added
to the hashing table which is initialized with the parameter item.
A pointer to the newly added entry is returned.
