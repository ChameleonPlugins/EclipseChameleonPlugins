int (*) (const char *, const struct stat *, int, struct FTW *)




The first three arguments are the same as for the __ftw_func_t
type.  However for the third argument some additional values are defined
to allow finer differentiation:

FTW_DP
The current item is a directory and all subdirectories have already been
visited and reported.  This flag is returned instead of FTW_D if
the FTW_DEPTH flag is passed to nftw (see below).

FTW_SLN
The current item is a stale symbolic link.  The file it points to does
not exist.



The last parameter of the callback function is a pointer to a structure
with some extra information as described below.

If the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 this
type is in fact __nftw64_func_t since this mode changes
struct stat to be struct stat64.
