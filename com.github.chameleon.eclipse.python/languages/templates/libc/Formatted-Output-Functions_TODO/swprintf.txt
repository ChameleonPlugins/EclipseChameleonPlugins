This is like wprintf, except that the output is stored in the
wide character array ws instead of written to a stream.  A null
wide character is written to mark the end of the string.  The size
argument specifies the maximum number of characters to produce.  The
trailing null character is counted towards this limit, so you should
allocate at least size wide characters for the string ws.

The return value is the number of characters generated for the given
input, excluding the trailing null.  If not all output fits into the
provided buffer a negative value is returned.  You should try again with
a bigger output string.  Note: this is different from how
snprintf handles this situation.

Note that the corresponding narrow stream function takes fewer
parameters.  swprintf in fact corresponds to the snprintf
function.  Since the sprintf function can be dangerous and should
be avoided the ISO C committee refused to make the same mistake
again and decided to not define a function exactly corresponding to
sprintf.
