Macro: int O_NONBLOCK
The bit that enables nonblocking mode for the file.  If this bit is set,
read requests on the file can return immediately with a failure
status if there is no input immediately available, instead of blocking.
Likewise, write requests can also return immediately with a
failure status if the output can’t be written immediately.

Note that the O_NONBLOCK flag is overloaded as both an I/O
operating mode and a file name translation flag; see Open-time Flags.
