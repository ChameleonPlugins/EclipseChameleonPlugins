The wcscat function is similar to wcscpy, except that the
characters from wfrom are concatenated or appended to the end of
wto, instead of overwriting it.  That is, the first character from
wfrom overwrites the null character marking the end of wto.

An equivalent definition for wcscat would be:


wchar_t *
wcscat (wchar_t *wto, const wchar_t *wfrom)
{
  wcscpy (wto + wcslen (wto), wfrom);
  return wto;
}


This function has undefined results if the strings overlap.
