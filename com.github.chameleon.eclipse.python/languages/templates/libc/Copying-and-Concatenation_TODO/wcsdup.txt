This function copies the null-terminated wide character string ws
into a newly allocated string.  The string is allocated using
malloc; see Unconstrained Allocation.  If malloc
cannot allocate space for the new string, wcsdup returns a null
pointer.  Otherwise it returns a pointer to the new wide character
string.

This function is a GNU extension.
