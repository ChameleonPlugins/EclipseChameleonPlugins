This function is like wcscpy, except that it returns a pointer to
the end of the string wto (that is, the address of the terminating
null character wto + strlen (wfrom)) rather than the beginning.

This function is not part of ISO or POSIX but was found useful while
developing the GNU C Library itself.

The behavior of wcpcpy is undefined if the strings overlap.

wcpcpy is a GNU extension and is declared in wchar.h.
