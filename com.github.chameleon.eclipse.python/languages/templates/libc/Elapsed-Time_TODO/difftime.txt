The difftime function returns the number of seconds of elapsed
time between calendar time time1 and calendar time time0, as
a value of type double.  The difference ignores leap seconds
unless leap second support is enabled.

In the GNU C Library, you can simply subtract time_t values.  But on
other systems, the time_t data type might use some other encoding
where subtraction doesn’t work directly.
