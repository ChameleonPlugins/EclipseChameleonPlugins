These functions are analogous to strtod, but return float
and long double values respectively.  They report errors in the
same way as strtod.  strtof can be substantially faster
than strtod, but has less precision; conversely, strtold
can be much slower but has more precision (on systems where long
double is a separate type).

These functions have been GNU extensions and are new to ISO C99.
