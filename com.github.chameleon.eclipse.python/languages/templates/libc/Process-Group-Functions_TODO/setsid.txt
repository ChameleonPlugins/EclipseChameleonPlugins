The setsid function creates a new session.  The calling process
becomes the session leader, and is put in a new process group whose
process group ID is the same as the process ID of that process.  There
are initially no other processes in the new process group, and no other
process groups in the new session.

This function also makes the calling process have no controlling terminal.

The setsid function returns the new process group ID of the
calling process if successful.  A return value of -1 indicates an
error.  The following errno error conditions are defined for this
function:


EPERM
The calling process is already a process group leader, or there is
already another process group around that has the same process group ID.
