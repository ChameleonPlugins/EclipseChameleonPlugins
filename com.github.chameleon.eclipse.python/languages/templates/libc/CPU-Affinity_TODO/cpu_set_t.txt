Data Type: cpu_set_t
This data set is a bitset where each bit represents a CPU.  How the
system’s CPUs are mapped to bits in the bitset is system dependent.
The data type has a fixed size; in the unlikely case that the number
of bits are not sufficient to describe the CPUs of the system a
different interface has to be used.

This type is a GNU extension and is defined in sched.h.
