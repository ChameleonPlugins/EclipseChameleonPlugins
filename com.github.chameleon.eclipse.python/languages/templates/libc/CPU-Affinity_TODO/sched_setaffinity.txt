This function installs the cpusetsize bytes long affinity mask
pointed to by cpuset for the process or thread with the ID pid.
If successful the function returns zero and the scheduler will in future
take the affinity information into account.

If the function fails it will return -1 and errno is set
to the error code:


ESRCH
No process or thread with the given ID found.


EFAULT
The pointer cpuset is does not point to a valid object.


EINVAL
The bitset is not valid.  This might mean that the affinity set might
not leave a processor for the process or thread to run on.



This function is a GNU extension and is declared in sched.h.
