This functions stores the CPU affinity mask for the process or thread
with the ID pid in the cpusetsize bytes long bitmap
pointed to by cpuset.  If successful, the function always
initializes all bits in the cpu_set_t object and returns zero.

If pid does not correspond to a process or thread on the system
the or the function fails for some other reason, it returns -1
and errno is set to represent the error condition.


ESRCH
No process or thread with the given ID found.


EFAULT
The pointer cpuset is does not point to a valid object.



This function is a GNU extension and is declared in sched.h.
