Window size change.  This is generated on some systems (including GNU)
when the terminal driver’s record of the number of rows and columns on
the screen is changed.  The default action is to ignore it.

If a program does full-screen display, it should handle SIGWINCH.
When the signal arrives, it should fetch the new screen size and
reformat its display accordingly.
