Information request.  On 4.4 BSD and GNU/Hurd systems, this signal is sent
to all the processes in the foreground process group of the controlling
terminal when the user types the STATUS character in canonical mode;
see Signal Characters.

If the process is the leader of the process group, the default action is
to print some status information about the system and what the process
is doing.  Otherwise the default is to do nothing.
