The SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals are set aside for you to
use any way you want.  They’re useful for simple interprocess
communication, if you write a signal handler for them in the program
that receives the signal.

There is an example showing the use of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
in Signaling Another Process.

The default action is to terminate the process.
