Macro: int EOF
This macro is an integer value that is returned by a number of narrow
stream functions to indicate an end-of-file condition, or some other
error situation.  With the GNU C Library, EOF is -1.  In
other libraries, its value may be some other negative number.

This symbol is declared in stdio.h.
