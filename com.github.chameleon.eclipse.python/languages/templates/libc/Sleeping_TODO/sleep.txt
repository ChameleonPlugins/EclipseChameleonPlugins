The sleep function waits for seconds or until a signal
is delivered, whichever happens first.

If sleep function returns because the requested interval is over,
it returns a value of zero.  If it returns because of delivery of a
signal, its return value is the remaining time in the sleep interval.

The sleep function is declared in unistd.h.
