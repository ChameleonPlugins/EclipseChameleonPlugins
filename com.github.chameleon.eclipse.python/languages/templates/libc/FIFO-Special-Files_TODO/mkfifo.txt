The mkfifo function makes a FIFO special file with name
filename.  The mode argument is used to set the file’s
permissions; see Setting Permissions.

The normal, successful return value from mkfifo is 0.  In
the case of an error, -1 is returned.  In addition to the usual
file name errors (see File Name Errors), the following
errno error conditions are defined for this function:


EEXIST
The named file already exists.


ENOSPC
The directory or file system cannot be extended.


EROFS
The directory that would contain the file resides on a read-only file
system.
