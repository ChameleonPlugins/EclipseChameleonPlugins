The __fpurge function causes the buffer of the stream
stream to be emptied.  If the stream is currently in read mode all
input in the buffer is lost.  If the stream is in output mode the
buffered output is not written to the device (or whatever other
underlying storage) and the buffer the cleared.

This function is declared in stdio_ext.h.
