This macro determines whether the argument x is less or greater
than y.  It is equivalent to (x) &lt; (y) ||
(x) &gt; (y) (although it only evaluates x and y
once), but no exception is raised if x or y are NaN.

This macro is not equivalent to x != y, because that
expression is true if x or y are NaN.
