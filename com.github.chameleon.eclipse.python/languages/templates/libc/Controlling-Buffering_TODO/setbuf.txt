If buf is a null pointer, the effect of this function is
equivalent to calling setvbuf with a mode argument of
_IONBF.  Otherwise, it is equivalent to calling setvbuf
with buf, and a mode of _IOFBF and a size
argument of BUFSIZ.

The setbuf function is provided for compatibility with old code;
use setvbuf in all new programs.
