This function is used to specify that the stream stream should
have the buffering mode mode, which can be either _IOFBF
(for full buffering), _IOLBF (for line buffering), or
_IONBF (for unbuffered input/output).

If you specify a null pointer as the buf argument, then setvbuf
allocates a buffer itself using malloc.  This buffer will be freed
when you close the stream.

Otherwise, buf should be a character array that can hold at least
size characters.  You should not free the space for this array as
long as the stream remains open and this array remains its buffer.  You
should usually either allocate it statically, or malloc
(see Unconstrained Allocation) the buffer.  Using an automatic array
is not a good idea unless you close the file before exiting the block
that declares the array.

While the array remains a stream buffer, the stream I/O functions will
use the buffer for their internal purposes.  You shouldn’t try to access
the values in the array directly while the stream is using it for
buffering.

The setvbuf function returns zero on success, or a nonzero value
if the value of mode is not valid or if the request could not
be honored.
