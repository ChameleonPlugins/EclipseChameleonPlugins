This is the subscript for the REPRINT character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VREPRINT] holds the character
itself.

The REPRINT character is recognized only in canonical mode.  It reprints
the current input line.  If some asynchronous output has come while you
are typing, this lets you see the line you are typing clearly again.

The REPRINT character is usually C-r.

This is a BSD extension.
