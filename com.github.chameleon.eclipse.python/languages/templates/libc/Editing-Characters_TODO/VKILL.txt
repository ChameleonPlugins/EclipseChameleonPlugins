This is the subscript for the KILL character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VKILL] holds the character
itself.

The KILL character is recognized only in canonical input mode.  When the
user types the kill character, the entire contents of the current line
of input are discarded.  The kill character itself is discarded too.

The KILL character is usually C-u.
