This is the subscript for the EOL character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VEOL] holds the character
itself.

The EOL character is recognized only in canonical input mode.  It acts
as a line terminator, just like a newline character.  The EOL character
is not discarded; it is read as the last character in the input line.


You don’t need to use the EOL character to make RET end a line.
Just set the ICRNL flag.  In fact, this is the default state of
affairs.
