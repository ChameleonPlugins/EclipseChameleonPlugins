This is the subscript for the ERASE character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VERASE] holds the
character itself.

The ERASE character is recognized only in canonical input mode.  When
the user types the erase character, the previous character typed is
discarded.  (If the terminal generates multibyte character sequences,
this may cause more than one byte of input to be discarded.)  This
cannot be used to erase past the beginning of the current line of text.
The ERASE character itself is discarded.

Usually, the ERASE character is DEL.
