This is the subscript for the EOF character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VEOF] holds the character
itself.

The EOF character is recognized only in canonical input mode.  It acts
as a line terminator in the same way as a newline character, but if the
EOF character is typed at the beginning of a line it causes read
to return a byte count of zero, indicating end-of-file.  The EOF
character itself is discarded.

Usually, the EOF character is C-d.
