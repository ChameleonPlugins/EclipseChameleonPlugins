This is the subscript for the EOL2 character in the special control
character array.  termios.c_cc[VEOL2] holds the character
itself.

The EOL2 character works just like the EOL character (see above), but it
can be a different character.  Thus, you can specify two characters to
terminate an input line, by setting EOL to one of them and EOL2 to the
other.

The EOL2 character is a BSD extension; it exists only on BSD systems
and GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd systems.
