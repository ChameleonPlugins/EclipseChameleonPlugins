The symlink function makes a symbolic link to oldname named
newname.

The normal return value from symlink is 0.  A return value
of -1 indicates an error.  In addition to the usual file name
syntax errors (see File Name Errors), the following errno
error conditions are defined for this function:


EEXIST
There is already an existing file named newname.


EROFS
The file newname would exist on a read-only file system.


ENOSPC
The directory or file system cannot be extended to make the new link.


EIO
A hardware error occurred while reading or writing data on the disk.
