Function: int fnmatch (const char *pattern, const char *string, int flags)

This function tests whether the string string matches the pattern
pattern.  It returns 0 if they do match; otherwise, it
returns the nonzero value FNM_NOMATCH.  The arguments
pattern and string are both strings.

The argument flags is a combination of flag bits that alter the
details of matching.  See below for a list of the defined flags.

In the GNU C Library, fnmatch might sometimes report “errors” by
returning nonzero values that are not equal to FNM_NOMATCH.
