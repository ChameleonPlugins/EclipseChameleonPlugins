The login functions inserts an entry into the user accounting
database.  The ut_line member is set to the name of the terminal
on standard input.  If standard input is not a terminal login
uses standard output or standard error output to determine the name of
the terminal.  If struct utmp has a ut_type member,
login sets it to USER_PROCESS, and if there is an
ut_pid member, it will be set to the process ID of the current
process.  The remaining entries are copied from entry.

A copy of the entry is written to the user accounting log file.
