This function replaces the process’s signal mask with set and then
suspends the process until a signal is delivered whose action is either
to terminate the process or invoke a signal handling function.  In other
words, the program is effectively suspended until one of the signals that
is not a member of set arrives.

If the process is woken up by delivery of a signal that invokes a handler
function, and the handler function returns, then sigsuspend also
returns.

The mask remains set only as long as sigsuspend is waiting.
The function sigsuspend always restores the previous signal mask
when it returns.

The return value and error conditions are the same as for pause.
