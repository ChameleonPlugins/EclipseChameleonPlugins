Macro: _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
If you define this macro an additional set of functions is made available
which enables 32 bit systems to use files of sizes beyond
the usual limit of 2GB.  This interface is not available if the system
does not support files that large.  On systems where the natural file
size limit is greater than 2GB (i.e., on 64 bit systems) the new
functions are identical to the replaced functions.

The new functionality is made available by a new set of types and
functions which replace the existing ones.  The names of these new objects
contain 64 to indicate the intention, e.g., off_t
vs. off64_t and fseeko vs. fseeko64.

This macro was introduced as part of the Large File Support extension
(LFS).  It is a transition interface for the period when 64 bit
offsets are not generally used (see _FILE_OFFSET_BITS).
