Macro: _LARGEFILE_SOURCE
If this macro is defined some extra functions are available which
rectify a few shortcomings in all previous standards.  Specifically,
the functions fseeko and ftello are available.  Without
these functions the difference between the ISO C interface
(fseek, ftell) and the low-level POSIX interface
(lseek) would lead to problems.

This macro was introduced as part of the Large File Support extension (LFS).
