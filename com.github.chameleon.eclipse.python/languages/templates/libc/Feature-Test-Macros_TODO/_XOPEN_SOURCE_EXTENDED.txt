Macro: _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
If you define this macro, functionality described in the X/Open
Portability Guide is included.  This is a superset of the POSIX.1 and
POSIX.2 functionality and in fact _POSIX_SOURCE and
_POSIX_C_SOURCE are automatically defined.

As the unification of all Unices, functionality only available in
BSD and SVID is also included.

If the macro _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is also defined, even more
functionality is available.  The extra functions will make all functions
available which are necessary for the X/Open Unix brand.

If the macro _XOPEN_SOURCE has the value 500 this includes
all functionality described so far plus some new definitions from the
Single Unix Specification, version 2.
