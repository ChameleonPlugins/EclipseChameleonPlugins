Macro: _POSIX_C_SOURCE
Define this macro to a positive integer to control which POSIX
functionality is made available.  The greater the value of this macro,
the more functionality is made available.

If you define this macro to a value greater than or equal to 1,
then the functionality from the 1990 edition of the POSIX.1 standard
(IEEE Standard 1003.1-1990) is made available.

If you define this macro to a value greater than or equal to 2,
then the functionality from the 1992 edition of the POSIX.2 standard
(IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992) is made available.

If you define this macro to a value greater than or equal to 199309L,
then the functionality from the 1993 edition of the POSIX.1b standard
(IEEE Standard 1003.1b-1993) is made available.

Greater values for _POSIX_C_SOURCE will enable future extensions.
The POSIX standards process will define these values as necessary, and
the GNU C Library should support them some time after they become standardized.
The 1996 edition of POSIX.1 (ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996) states that
if you define _POSIX_C_SOURCE to a value greater than
or equal to 199506L, then the functionality from the 1996
edition is made available.
