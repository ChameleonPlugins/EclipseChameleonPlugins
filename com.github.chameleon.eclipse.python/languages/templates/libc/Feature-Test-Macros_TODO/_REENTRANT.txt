If you define one of these macros, reentrant versions of several functions get
declared.  Some of the functions are specified in POSIX.1c but many others
are only available on a few other systems or are unique to the GNU C Library.
The problem is the delay in the standardization of the thread safe C library
interface.

Unlike on some other systems, no special version of the C library must be
used for linking.  There is only one version but while compiling this
it must have been specified to compile as thread safe.
