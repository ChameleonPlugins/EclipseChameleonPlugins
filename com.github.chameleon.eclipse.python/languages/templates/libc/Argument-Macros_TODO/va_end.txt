This ends the use of ap.  After a va_end call, further
va_arg calls with the same ap may not work.  You should invoke
va_end before returning from the function in which va_start
was invoked with the same ap argument.

In the GNU C Library, va_end does nothing, and you need not ever
use it except for reasons of portability.
