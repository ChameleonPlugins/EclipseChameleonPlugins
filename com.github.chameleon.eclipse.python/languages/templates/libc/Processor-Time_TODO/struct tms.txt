Data Type: struct tms
The tms structure is used to return information about process
times.  It contains at least the following members:


clock_t tms_utime
This is the total processor time the calling process has used in
executing the instructions of its program.


clock_t tms_stime
This is the processor time the system has used on behalf of the calling
process.


clock_t tms_cutime
This is the sum of the tms_utime values and the tms_cutime
values of all terminated child processes of the calling process, whose
status has been reported to the parent process by wait or
waitpid; see Process Completion.  In other words, it
represents the total processor time used in executing the instructions
of all the terminated child processes of the calling process, excluding
child processes which have not yet been reported by wait or
waitpid.



clock_t tms_cstime
This is similar to tms_cutime, but represents the total processor
time system has used on behalf of all the terminated child processes
of the calling process.



All of the times are given in numbers of clock ticks.  Unlike CPU time,
these are the actual amounts of time; not relative to any event.
