Print a given floating point number as for the format %f except
that there is a postfix character indicating the divisor for the
number to make this less than 1000.  There are two possible divisors:
powers of 1024 or powers of 1000.  Which one is used depends on the
format character specified while registered this handler.  If the
character is of lower case, 1024 is used.  For upper case characters,
1000 is used.

The postfix tag corresponds to bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes,
etc.  The full table is:


The default precision is 3, i.e., 1024 is printed with a lower-case
format character as if it were %.3fk and will yield 1.000k.
