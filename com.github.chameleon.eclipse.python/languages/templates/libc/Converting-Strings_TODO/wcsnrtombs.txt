The wcsnrtombs function implements the conversion from wide
character strings to multibyte character strings.  It is similar to
wcsrtombs but, just like mbsnrtowcs, it takes an extra
parameter, which specifies the length of the input string.

No more than nwc wide characters from the input string
*src are converted.  If the input string contains a NUL
wide character in the first nwc characters, the conversion stops at
this place.

The wcsnrtombs function is a GNU extension and just like
mbsnrtowcs helps in situations where no NUL-terminated input
strings are available.
