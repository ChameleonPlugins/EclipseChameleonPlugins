This function can be used to check whether the string pointed to by the
mnt_opts element of the variable pointed to by mnt contains
the option opt.  If this is true a pointer to the beginning of the
option in the mnt_opts element is returned.  If no such option
exists the function returns NULL.

This function is useful to test whether a specific option is present but
when all options have to be processed one is better off with using the
getsubopt function to iterate over all options in the string.
