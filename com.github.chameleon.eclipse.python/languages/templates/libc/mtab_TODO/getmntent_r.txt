The getmntent_r function is the reentrant variant of
getmntent.  It also returns the next entry from the file and
returns a pointer.  The actual variable the values are stored in is not
static, though.  Instead the function stores the values in the variable
pointed to by the result parameter.  Additional information (e.g.,
the strings pointed to by the elements of the result) are kept in the
buffer of size bufsize pointed to by buffer.

Escaped characters (space, tab, backslash) are converted back in the
same way as it happens for getmentent.

The function returns a NULL pointer in error cases.  Errors could be:

 error while reading the file,
 end of file reached,
 bufsize is too small for reading a complete new entry.
