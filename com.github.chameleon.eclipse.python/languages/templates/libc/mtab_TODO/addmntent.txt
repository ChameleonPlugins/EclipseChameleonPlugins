The addmntent function allows adding a new entry to the file
previously opened with setmntent.  The new entries are always
appended.  I.e., even if the position of the file descriptor is not at
the end of the file this function does not overwrite an existing entry
following the current position.

The implication of this is that to remove an entry from a file one has
to create a new file while leaving out the entry to be removed and after
closing the file remove the old one and rename the new file to the
chosen name.

This function takes care of spaces and tab characters in the names to be
written to the file.  It converts them and the backslash character into
the format describe in the getmntent description above.

This function returns 0 in case the operation was successful.
Otherwise the return value is 1 and errno is set
appropriately.
