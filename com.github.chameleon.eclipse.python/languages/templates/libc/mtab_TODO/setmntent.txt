The setmntent function prepares the file named FILE which
must be in the format of a fstab and mtab file for the
upcoming processing through the other functions of the family.  The
mode parameter can be chosen in the way the opentype
parameter for fopen (see Opening Streams) can be chosen.  If
the file is opened for writing the file is also allowed to be empty.

If the file was successfully opened setmntent returns a file
descriptor for future use.  Otherwise the return value is NULL
and errno is set accordingly.
