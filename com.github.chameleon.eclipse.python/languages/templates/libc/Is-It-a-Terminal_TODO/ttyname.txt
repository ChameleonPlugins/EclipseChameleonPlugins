If the file descriptor filedes is associated with a terminal
device, the ttyname function returns a pointer to a
statically-allocated, null-terminated string containing the file name of
the terminal file.  The value is a null pointer if the file descriptor
isn’t associated with a terminal, or the file name cannot be determined.
