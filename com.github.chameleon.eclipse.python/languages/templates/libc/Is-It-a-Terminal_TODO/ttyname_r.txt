The ttyname_r function is similar to the ttyname function
except that it places its result into the user-specified buffer starting
at buf with length len.

The normal return value from ttyname_r is 0.  Otherwise an
error number is returned to indicate the error.  The following
errno error conditions are defined for this function:


EBADF
The filedes argument is not a valid file descriptor.


ENOTTY
The filedes is not associated with a terminal.


ERANGE
The buffer length len is too small to store the string to be
returned.
