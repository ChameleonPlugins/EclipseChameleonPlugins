The sigpending function stores information about pending signals
in set.  If there is a pending signal that is blocked from
delivery, then that signal is a member of the returned set.  (You can
test whether a particular signal is a member of this set using
sigismember; see Signal Sets.)

The return value is 0 if successful, and -1 on failure.
