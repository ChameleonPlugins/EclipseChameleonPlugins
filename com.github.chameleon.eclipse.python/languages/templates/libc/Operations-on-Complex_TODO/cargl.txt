These functions return the argument of the complex number z.
The argument of a complex number is the angle in the complex plane
between the positive real axis and a line passing through zero and the
number.  This angle is measured in the usual fashion and ranges from
-&amp;pi; to &amp;pi;.

carg has a branch cut along the negative real axis.
