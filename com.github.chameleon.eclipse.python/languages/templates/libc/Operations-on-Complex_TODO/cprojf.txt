These functions return the projection of the complex value z onto
the Riemann sphere.  Values with an infinite imaginary part are projected
to positive infinity on the real axis, even if the real part is NaN.  If
the real part is infinite, the result is equivalent to


INFINITY + I * copysign (0.0, cimag (z))
