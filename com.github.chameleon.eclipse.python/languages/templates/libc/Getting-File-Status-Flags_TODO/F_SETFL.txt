Macro: int F_SETFL
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to set
the file status flags for the open file corresponding to the
filedes argument.  This command requires a third int
argument to specify the new flags, so the call looks like this:


fcntl (filedes, F_SETFL, new-flags)


You can’t change the access mode for the file in this way; that is,
whether the file descriptor was opened for reading or writing.

The normal return value from fcntl with this command is an
unspecified value other than -1, which indicates an error.  The
error conditions are the same as for the F_GETFL command.
