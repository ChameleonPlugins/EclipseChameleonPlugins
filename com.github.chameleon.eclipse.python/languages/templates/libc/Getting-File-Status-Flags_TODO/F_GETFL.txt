This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to
read the file status flags for the open file with descriptor
filedes.

The normal return value from fcntl with this command is a
nonnegative number which can be interpreted as the bitwise OR of the
individual flags.  Since the file access modes are not single-bit values,
you can mask off other bits in the returned flags with O_ACCMODE
to compare them.

In case of an error, fcntl returns -1.  The following
errno error conditions are defined for this command:


EBADF
The filedes argument is invalid.
