This bit is like ECHOE, enables display of the ERASE character in
a way that is geared to a hardcopy terminal.  When you type the ERASE
character, a ‘\’ character is printed followed by the first
character erased.  Typing the ERASE character again just prints the next
character erased.  Then, the next time you type a normal character, a
‘/’ character is printed before the character echoes.

This is a BSD extension, and exists only in BSD systems and
GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd systems.
