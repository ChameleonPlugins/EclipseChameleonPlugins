Macro: tcflag_t ECHOCTL
If this bit is set and the ECHO bit is also set, echo control
characters with ‘^’ followed by the corresponding text character.
Thus, control-A echoes as ‘^A’.  This is usually the preferred mode
for interactive input, because echoing a control character back to the
terminal could have some undesired effect on the terminal.

This is a BSD extension, and exists only in BSD systems and
GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd systems.
