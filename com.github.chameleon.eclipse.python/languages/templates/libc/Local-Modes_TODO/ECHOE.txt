Macro: tcflag_t ECHOE
If this bit is set, echoing indicates erasure of input with the ERASE
character by erasing the last character in the current line from the
screen.  Otherwise, the character erased is re-echoed to show what has
happened (suitable for a printing terminal).

This bit only controls the display behavior; the ICANON bit by
itself controls actual recognition of the ERASE character and erasure of
input, without which ECHOE is simply irrelevant.
