This bit controls whether the INTR, QUIT, and SUSP characters are
recognized.  The functions associated with these characters are performed
if and only if this bit is set.  Being in canonical or noncanonical
input mode has no affect on the interpretation of these characters.

You should use caution when disabling recognition of these characters.
Programs that cannot be interrupted interactively are very
user-unfriendly.  If you clear this bit, your program should provide
some alternate interface that allows the user to interactively send the
signals associated with these characters, or to escape from the program.
