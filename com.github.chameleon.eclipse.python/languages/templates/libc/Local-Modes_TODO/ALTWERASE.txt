This bit determines how far the WERASE character should erase.  The
WERASE character erases back to the beginning of a word; the question
is, where do words begin?

If this bit is clear, then the beginning of a word is a nonwhitespace
character following a whitespace character.  If the bit is set, then the
beginning of a word is an alphanumeric character or underscore following
a character which is none of those.

See Editing Characters, for more information about the WERASE character.
