This bit enables special display of the KILL character by moving to a
new line after echoing the KILL character normally.  The behavior of
ECHOKE (below) is nicer to look at.

If this bit is not set, the KILL character echoes just as it would if it
were not the KILL character.  Then it is up to the user to remember that
the KILL character has erased the preceding input; there is no
indication of this on the screen.

This bit only controls the display behavior; the ICANON bit by
itself controls actual recognition of the KILL character and erasure of
input, without which ECHOK is simply irrelevant.
