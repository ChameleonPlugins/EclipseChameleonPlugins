Data Type: lldiv_t
This is a structure type used to hold the result returned by the lldiv
function.  It has the following members:


long long int quot
The quotient from the division.


long long int rem
The remainder from the division.



(This is identical to div_t except that the components are of
type long long int rather than int.)
