The localtime function converts the simple time pointed to by
time to broken-down time representation, expressed relative to the
user’s specified time zone.

The return value is a pointer to a static broken-down time structure, which
might be overwritten by subsequent calls to ctime, gmtime,
or localtime.  (But no other library function overwrites the contents
of this object.)

The return value is the null pointer if time cannot be represented
as a broken-down time; typically this is because the year cannot fit into
an int.

Calling localtime also sets the current time zone as if
tzset were called.  See Time Zone Functions.
