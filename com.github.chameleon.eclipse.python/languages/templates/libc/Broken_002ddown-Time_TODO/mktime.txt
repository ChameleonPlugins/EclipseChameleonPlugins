The mktime function converts a broken-down time structure to a
simple time representation.  It also normalizes the contents of the
broken-down time structure, and fills in some components based on the
values of the others.

The mktime function ignores the specified contents of the
tm_wday, tm_yday, tm_gmtoff, and tm_zone
members of the broken-down time
structure.  It uses the values of the other components to determine the
calendar time; it’s permissible for these components to have
unnormalized values outside their normal ranges.  The last thing that
mktime does is adjust the components of the brokentime
structure, including the members that were initially ignored.

If the specified broken-down time cannot be represented as a simple time,
mktime returns a value of (time_t)(-1) and does not modify
the contents of brokentime.

Calling mktime also sets the current time zone as if
tzset were called; mktime uses this information instead
of brokentime’s initial tm_gmtoff and tm_zone
members.  See Time Zone Functions.
