This signal is sent when a file descriptor is ready to perform input
or output.

On most operating systems, terminals and sockets are the only kinds of
files that can generate SIGIO; other kinds, including ordinary
files, never generate SIGIO even if you ask them to.

On GNU systems SIGIO will always be generated properly
if you successfully set asynchronous mode with fcntl.
