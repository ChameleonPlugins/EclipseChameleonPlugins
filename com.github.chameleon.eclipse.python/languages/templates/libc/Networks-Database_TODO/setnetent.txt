This function opens and rewinds the networks database.

If the stayopen argument is nonzero, this sets a flag so that
subsequent calls to getnetbyname or getnetbyaddr will
not close the database (as they usually would).  This makes for more
efficiency if you call those functions several times, by avoiding
reopening the database for each call.
