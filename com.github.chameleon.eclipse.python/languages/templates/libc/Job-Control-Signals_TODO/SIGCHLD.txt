This signal is sent to a parent process whenever one of its child
processes terminates or stops.

The default action for this signal is to ignore it.  If you establish a
handler for this signal while there are child processes that have
terminated but not reported their status via wait or
waitpid (see Process Completion), whether your new handler
applies to those processes or not depends on the particular operating
system.
