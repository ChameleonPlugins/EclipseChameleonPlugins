Macro: int F_GETFD
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to
specify that it should return the file descriptor flags associated
with the filedes argument.

The normal return value from fcntl with this command is a
nonnegative number which can be interpreted as the bitwise OR of the
individual flags (except that currently there is only one flag to use).

In case of an error, fcntl returns -1.  The following
errno error conditions are defined for this command:


EBADF
The filedes argument is invalid.
