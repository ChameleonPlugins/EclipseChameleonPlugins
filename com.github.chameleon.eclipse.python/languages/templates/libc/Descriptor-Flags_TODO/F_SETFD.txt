Macro: int F_SETFD
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to
specify that it should set the file descriptor flags associated with the
filedes argument.  This requires a third int argument to
specify the new flags, so the form of the call is:


fcntl (filedes, F_SETFD, new-flags)


The normal return value from fcntl with this command is an
unspecified value other than -1, which indicates an error.
The flags and error conditions are the same as for the F_GETFD
command.
