These functions return sqrt (x*x +
y*y).  This is the length of the hypotenuse of a right
triangle with sides of length x and y, or the distance
of the point (x, y) from the origin.  Using this function
instead of the direct formula is wise, since the error is
much smaller.  See also the function cabs in Absolute Value.
