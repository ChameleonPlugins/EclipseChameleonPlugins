These functions extract the exponent of x and return it as a
floating-point value.  If FLT_RADIX is two, logb is equal
to floor (log2 (x)), except it’s probably faster.

If x is de-normalized, logb returns the exponent x
would have if it were normalized.  If x is infinity (positive or
negative), logb returns &amp;infin;.  If x is zero,
logb returns &amp;infin;.  It does not signal.
