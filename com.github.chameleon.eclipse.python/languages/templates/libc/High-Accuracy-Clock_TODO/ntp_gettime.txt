The ntp_gettime function sets the structure pointed to by
tptr to current values.  The elements of the structure afterwards
contain the values the timer implementation in the kernel assumes.  They
might or might not be correct.  If they are not a ntp_adjtime
call is necessary.

The return value is 0 on success and other values on failure.  The
following errno error conditions are defined for this function:


TIME_ERROR
The precision clock model is not properly set up at the moment, thus the
clock must be considered unsynchronized, and the values should be
treated with care.
