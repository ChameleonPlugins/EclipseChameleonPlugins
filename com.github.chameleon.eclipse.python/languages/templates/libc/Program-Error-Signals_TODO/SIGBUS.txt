Macro: int SIGBUS
This signal is generated when an invalid pointer is dereferenced.  Like
SIGSEGV, this signal is typically the result of dereferencing an
uninitialized pointer.  The difference between the two is that
SIGSEGV indicates an invalid access to valid memory, while
SIGBUS indicates an access to an invalid address.  In particular,
SIGBUS signals often result from dereferencing a misaligned
pointer, such as referring to a four-word integer at an address not
divisible by four.  (Each kind of computer has its own requirements for
address alignment.)

The name of this signal is an abbreviation for “bus error”.
