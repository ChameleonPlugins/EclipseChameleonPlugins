Function: int fstat64 (int filedes, struct stat64 *buf)

This function is similar to fstat but is able to work on large
files on 32-bit platforms.  For large files the file descriptor
filedes should be obtained by open64 or creat64.
The buf pointer points to a variable of type struct stat64
which is able to represent the larger values.

When the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 this
function is available under the name fstat and so transparently
replaces the interface for small files on 32-bit machines.
