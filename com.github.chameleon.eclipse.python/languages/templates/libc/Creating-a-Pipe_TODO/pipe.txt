The pipe function creates a pipe and puts the file descriptors
for the reading and writing ends of the pipe (respectively) into
filedes[0] and filedes[1].

An easy way to remember that the input end comes first is that file
descriptor 0 is standard input, and file descriptor 1 is
standard output.

If successful, pipe returns a value of 0.  On failure,
-1 is returned.  The following errno error conditions are
defined for this function:


EMFILE
The process has too many files open.


ENFILE
There are too many open files in the entire system.  See Error Codes,
for more information about ENFILE.  This error never occurs on
GNU/Hurd systems.
