Macro: float INFINITY
An expression representing positive infinity.  It is equal to the value
produced  by mathematical operations like 1.0 / 0.0.
-INFINITY represents negative infinity.

You can test whether a floating-point value is infinite by comparing it
to this macro.  However, this is not recommended; you should use the
isfinite macro instead.  See Floating Point Classes.

This macro was introduced in the ISO C99 standard.
