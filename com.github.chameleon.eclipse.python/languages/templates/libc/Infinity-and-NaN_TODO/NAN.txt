Macro: float NAN
An expression representing a value which is “not a number”.  This
macro is a GNU extension, available only on machines that support the
“not a number” value—that is to say, on all machines that support
IEEE floating point.

You can use ‘#ifdef NAN’ to test whether the machine supports
NaN.  (Of course, you must arrange for GNU extensions to be visible,
such as by defining _GNU_SOURCE, and then you must include
math.h.)
