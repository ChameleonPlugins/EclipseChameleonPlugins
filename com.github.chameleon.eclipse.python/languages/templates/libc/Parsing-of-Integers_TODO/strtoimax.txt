The strtoimax function is like strtol except that it returns
a intmax_t value, and accepts numbers of a corresponding range.

If the string has valid syntax for an integer but the value is not
representable because of overflow, strtoimax returns either
INTMAX_MAX or INTMAX_MIN (see Integers), as
appropriate for the sign of the value.  It also sets errno to
ERANGE to indicate there was overflow.

See Integers for a description of the intmax_t type.  The
strtoimax function was introduced in ISO C99.
