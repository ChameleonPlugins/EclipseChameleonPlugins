The wctob function (“wide character to byte”) takes as the
parameter a valid wide character.  If the multibyte representation for
this character in the initial state is exactly one byte long, the return
value of this function is this character.  Otherwise the return value is
EOF.


wctob was introduced in Amendment 1 to ISO C90 and
is declared in wchar.h.
