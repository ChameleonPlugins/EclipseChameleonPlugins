The sigismember function tests whether the signal signum is
a member of the signal set set.  It returns 1 if the signal
is in the set, 0 if not, and -1 if there is an error.

The following errno error condition is defined for this function:


EINVAL
The signum argument doesn’t specify a valid signal.
