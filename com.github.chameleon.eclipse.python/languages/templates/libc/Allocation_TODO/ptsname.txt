If the file descriptor filedes is associated with a
master pseudo-terminal device, the ptsname function returns a
pointer to a statically-allocated, null-terminated string containing the
file name of the associated slave pseudo-terminal file.  This string
might be overwritten by subsequent calls to ptsname.
