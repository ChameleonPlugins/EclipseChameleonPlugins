The unlockpt function unlocks the slave pseudo-terminal device
corresponding to the master pseudo-terminal device associated with the
file descriptor filedes.  On many systems, the slave can only be
opened after unlocking, so portable applications should always call
unlockpt before trying to open the slave.

The normal return value from unlockpt is 0; a value of
-1 is returned in case of failure.  The following errno
error conditions are defined for this function:


EBADF
The filedes argument is not a valid file descriptor.


EINVAL
The filedes argument is not associated with a master pseudo-terminal
device.
