The grantpt function changes the ownership and access permission
of the slave pseudo-terminal device corresponding to the master
pseudo-terminal device associated with the file descriptor
filedes.  The owner is set from the real user ID of the calling
process (see Process Persona), and the group is set to a special
group (typically tty) or from the real group ID of the calling
process.  The access permission is set such that the file is both
readable and writable by the owner and only writable by the group.

On some systems this function is implemented by invoking a special
setuid root program (see How Change Persona).  As a
consequence, installing a signal handler for the SIGCHLD signal
(see Job Control Signals) may interfere with a call to
grantpt.

The normal return value from grantpt is 0; a value of
-1 is returned in case of failure.  The following errno
error conditions are defined for this function:


EBADF
The filedes argument is not a valid file descriptor.


EINVAL
The filedes argument is not associated with a master pseudo-terminal
device.


EACCES
The slave pseudo-terminal device corresponding to the master associated
with filedes could not be accessed.
