Not supported.  A function returns this error when certain parameter
values are valid, but the functionality they request is not available.
This can mean that the function does not implement a particular command
or option value or flag bit at all.  For functions that operate on some
object given in a parameter, such as a file descriptor or a port, it
might instead mean that only that specific object (file
descriptor, port, etc.) is unable to support the other parameters given;
different file descriptors might support different ranges of parameter
values.

If the entire function is not available at all in the implementation,
it returns ENOSYS instead.
