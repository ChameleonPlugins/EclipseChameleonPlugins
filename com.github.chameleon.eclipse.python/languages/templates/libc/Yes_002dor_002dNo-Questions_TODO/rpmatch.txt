The function rpmatch checks the string in response whether
or not it is a correct yes-or-no answer and if yes, which one.  The
check uses the YESEXPR and NOEXPR data in the
LC_MESSAGES category of the currently selected locale.  The
return value is as follows:


1
The user entered an affirmative answer.


0
The user entered a negative answer.


-1
The answer matched neither the YESEXPR nor the NOEXPR
regular expression.



This function is not standardized but available beside in the GNU C Library at
least also in the IBM AIX library.
