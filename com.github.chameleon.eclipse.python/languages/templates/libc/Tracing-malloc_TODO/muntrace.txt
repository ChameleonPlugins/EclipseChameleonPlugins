The muntrace function can be called after mtrace was used
to enable tracing the malloc calls.  If no (successful) call of
mtrace was made muntrace does nothing.

Otherwise it deinstalls the handlers for malloc, realloc,
and free and then closes the protocol file.  No calls are
protocolled anymore and the program runs again at full speed.

This function is a GNU extension and generally not available on other
systems.  The prototype can be found in mcheck.h.
