Data Type: fpos_t
This is the type of an object that can encode information about the
file position of a stream, for use by the functions fgetpos and
fsetpos.

In the GNU C Library, fpos_t is an opaque data structure that
contains internal data to represent file offset and conversion state
information.  In other systems, it might have a different internal
representation.

When compiling with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 on a 32 bit machine
this type is in fact equivalent to fpos64_t since the LFS
interface transparently replaces the old interface.
