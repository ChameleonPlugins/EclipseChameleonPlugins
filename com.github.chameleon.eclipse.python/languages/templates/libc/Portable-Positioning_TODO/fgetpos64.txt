This function is similar to fgetpos but the file position is
returned in a variable of type fpos64_t to which position
points.

If the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 on a 32
bits machine this function is available under the name fgetpos
and so transparently replaces the old interface.
