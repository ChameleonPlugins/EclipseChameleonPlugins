This function stores the value of the file position indicator for the
stream stream in the fpos_t object pointed to by
position.  If successful, fgetpos returns zero; otherwise
it returns a nonzero value and stores an implementation-defined positive
value in errno.

When the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 on a
32 bit system the function is in fact fgetpos64.  I.e., the LFS
interface transparently replaces the old interface.
