This function is similar to fsetpos but the file position used
for positioning is provided in a variable of type fpos64_t to
which position points.

If the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 on a 32
bits machine this function is available under the name fsetpos
and so transparently replaces the old interface.
