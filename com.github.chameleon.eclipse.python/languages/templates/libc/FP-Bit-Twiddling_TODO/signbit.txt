signbit is a generic macro which can work on all floating-point
types.  It returns a nonzero value if the value of x has its sign
bit set.

This is not the same as x &lt; 0.0, because IEEE 754 floating
point allows zero to be signed.  The comparison -0.0 &lt; 0.0 is
false, but signbit (-0.0) will return a nonzero value.
