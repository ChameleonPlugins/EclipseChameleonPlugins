These functions return x but with the sign of y.  They work
even if x or y are NaN or zero.  Both of these can carry a
sign (although not all implementations support it) and this is one of
the few operations that can tell the difference.

copysign never raises an exception.

This function is defined in IEC 559 (and the appendix with
recommended functions in IEEE 754/IEEE 854).
