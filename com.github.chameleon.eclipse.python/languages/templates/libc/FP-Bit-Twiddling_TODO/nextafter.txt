The nextafter function returns the next representable neighbor of
x in the direction towards y.  The size of the step between
x and the result depends on the type of the result.  If
x = y the function simply returns y.  If either
value is NaN, NaN is returned.  Otherwise
a value corresponding to the value of the least significant bit in the
mantissa is added or subtracted, depending on the direction.
nextafter will signal overflow or underflow if the result goes
outside of the range of normalized numbers.

This function is defined in IEC 559 (and the appendix with
recommended functions in IEEE 754/IEEE 854).
