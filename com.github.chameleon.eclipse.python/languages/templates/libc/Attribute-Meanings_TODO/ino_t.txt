This is an unsigned integer type used to represent file serial numbers.
(In Unix jargon, these are sometimes called inode numbers.)
In the GNU C Library, this type is no narrower than unsigned int.

If the source is compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64 this type
is transparently replaced by ino64_t.
