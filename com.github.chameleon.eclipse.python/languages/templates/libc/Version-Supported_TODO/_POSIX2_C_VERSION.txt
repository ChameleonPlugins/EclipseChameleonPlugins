Macro: long int _POSIX2_C_VERSION
This constant represents the version of the POSIX.2 standard which the
library and system kernel support.  We don’t know what value this will
be for the first version of the POSIX.2 standard, because the value is
based on the year and month in which the standard is officially adopted.

The value of this symbol says nothing about the utilities installed on
the system.

Usage Note: You can use this macro to tell whether a POSIX.1
system library supports POSIX.2 as well.  Any POSIX.1 system contains
unistd.h, so include that file and then test defined
(_POSIX2_C_VERSION).
