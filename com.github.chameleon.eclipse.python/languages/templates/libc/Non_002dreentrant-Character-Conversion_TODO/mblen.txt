The mblen function with a non-null string argument returns
the number of bytes that make up the multibyte character beginning at
string, never examining more than size bytes.  (The idea is
to supply for size the number of bytes of data you have in hand.)

The return value of mblen distinguishes three possibilities: the
first size bytes at string start with valid multibyte
characters, they start with an invalid byte sequence or just part of a
character, or string points to an empty string (a null character).

For a valid multibyte character, mblen returns the number of
bytes in that character (always at least 1 and never more than
size).  For an invalid byte sequence, mblen returns
-1.  For an empty string, it returns 0.

If the multibyte character code uses shift characters, then mblen
maintains and updates a shift state as it scans.  If you call
mblen with a null pointer for string, that initializes the
shift state to its standard initial value.  It also returns a nonzero
value if the multibyte character code in use actually has a shift state.
See Shift State.


The function mblen is declared in stdlib.h.
