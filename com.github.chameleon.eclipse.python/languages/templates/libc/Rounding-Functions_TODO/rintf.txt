These functions round x to an integer value according to the
current rounding mode.  See Floating Point Parameters, for
information about the various rounding modes.  The default
rounding mode is to round to the nearest integer; some machines
support other modes, but round-to-nearest is always used unless
you explicitly select another.

If x was not initially an integer, these functions raise the
inexact exception.
