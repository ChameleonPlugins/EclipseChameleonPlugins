Function: int socketpair (int namespace, int style, int protocol, int filedes[2])

This function creates a socket pair, returning the file descriptors in
filedes[0] and filedes[1].  The socket pair
is a full-duplex communications channel, so that both reading and writing
may be performed at either end.

The namespace, style and protocol arguments are
interpreted as for the socket function.  style should be
one of the communication styles listed in Communication Styles.
The namespace argument specifies the namespace, which must be
AF_LOCAL (see Local Namespace); protocol specifies the
communications protocol, but zero is the only meaningful value.

If style specifies a connectionless communication style, then
the two sockets you get are not connected, strictly speaking,
but each of them knows the other as the default destination address,
so they can send packets to each other.

The socketpair function returns 0 on success and -1
on failure.  The following errno error conditions are defined
for this function:


EMFILE
The process has too many file descriptors open.


EAFNOSUPPORT
The specified namespace is not supported.


EPROTONOSUPPORT
The specified protocol is not supported.


EOPNOTSUPP
The specified protocol does not support the creation of socket pairs.
