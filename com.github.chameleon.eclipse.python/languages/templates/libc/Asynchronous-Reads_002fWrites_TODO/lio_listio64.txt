This function is similar to the lio_listio function.  The only
difference is that on 32 bit machines, the file descriptor should
be opened in the large file mode.  Internally, lio_listio64 uses
functionality equivalent to lseek64 (see File Position Primitive) to position the file descriptor correctly for the reading or
writing, as opposed to lseek functionality used in
lio_listio.

When the sources are compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64, this
function is available under the name lio_listio and so
transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32 bit
machines.
