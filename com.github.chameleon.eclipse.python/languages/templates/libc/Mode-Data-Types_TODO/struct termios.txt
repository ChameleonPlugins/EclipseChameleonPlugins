Data Type: struct termios
Structure that records all the I/O attributes of a terminal.  The
structure includes at least the following members:


tcflag_t c_iflag
A bit mask specifying flags for input modes; see Input Modes.


tcflag_t c_oflag
A bit mask specifying flags for output modes; see Output Modes.


tcflag_t c_cflag
A bit mask specifying flags for control modes; see Control Modes.


tcflag_t c_lflag
A bit mask specifying flags for local modes; see Local Modes.


cc_t c_cc[NCCS]
An array specifying which characters are associated with various
control functions; see Special Characters.



The struct termios structure also contains members which
encode input and output transmission speeds, but the representation is
not specified.  See Line Speed, for how to examine and store the
speed values.
