closelog closes the current Syslog connection, if there is one.
This includes closing the /dev/log socket, if it is open.
closelog also sets the identification string for Syslog messages
back to the default, if openlog was called with a non-NULL argument
to ident.  The default identification string is the program name
taken from argv[0].

If you are writing shared library code that uses openlog to
generate custom syslog output, you should use closelog to drop
the GNU C Library’s internal reference to the ident pointer when you are
done.  Please read the section on openlog for more information:
See openlog.

closelog does not flush any buffers.  You do not have to call
closelog before re-opening a Syslog connection with openlog.
Syslog connections are automatically closed on exec or exit.
