This function returns an array of if_nameindex structures, one
for every interface that is present.  The end of the list is indicated
by a structure with an interface of 0 and a null name pointer.  If an
error occurs, this function returns a null pointer.

The returned structure must be freed with if_freenameindex after
use.
