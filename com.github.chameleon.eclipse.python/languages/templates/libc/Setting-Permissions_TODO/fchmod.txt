This is like chmod, except that it changes the permissions of the
currently open file given by filedes.

The return value from fchmod is 0 on success and -1
on failure.  The following errno error codes are defined for this
function:


EBADF
The filedes argument is not a valid file descriptor.


EINVAL
The filedes argument corresponds to a pipe or socket, or something
else that doesn’t really have access permissions.


EPERM
This process does not have permission to change the access permissions
of this file.  Only the file’s owner (as judged by the effective user ID
of the process) or a privileged user can change them.


EROFS
The file resides on a read-only file system.
