The chmod function sets the access permission bits for the file
named by filename to mode.

If filename is a symbolic link, chmod changes the
permissions of the file pointed to by the link, not those of the link
itself.

This function returns 0 if successful and -1 if not.  In
addition to the usual file name errors (see File Name Errors), the following errno error conditions are defined for
this function:


ENOENT
The named file doesn’t exist.


EPERM
This process does not have permission to change the access permissions
of this file.  Only the file’s owner (as judged by the effective user ID
of the process) or a privileged user can change them.


EROFS
The file resides on a read-only file system.


EFTYPE
mode has the S_ISVTX bit (the “sticky bit”) set,
and the named file is not a directory.  Some systems do not allow setting the
sticky bit on non-directory files, and some do (and only some of those
assign a useful meaning to the bit for non-directory files).

You only get EFTYPE on systems where the sticky bit has no useful
meaning for non-directory files, so it is always safe to just clear the
bit in mode and call chmod again.  See Permission Bits,
for full details on the sticky bit.
