Macro: int NGROUPS_MAX
The maximum number of supplementary group IDs that one process can have.

The value of this macro is actually a lower bound for the maximum.  That
is, you can count on being able to have that many supplementary group
IDs, but a particular machine might let you have even more.  You can use
sysconf to see whether a particular machine will let you have
more (see Sysconf).
