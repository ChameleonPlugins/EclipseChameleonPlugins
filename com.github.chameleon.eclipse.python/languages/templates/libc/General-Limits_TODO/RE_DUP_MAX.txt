Macro: int RE_DUP_MAX
The largest number of repetitions you are guaranteed is allowed in the
construct ‘\{min,max\}’ in a regular expression.

The value of this macro is actually a lower bound for the maximum.  That
is, you can count on being able to have that many repetitions, but a
particular machine might let you have even more.  You can use
sysconf to see whether a particular machine will let you have
more (see Sysconf).  And even the value that sysconf tells
you is just a lower bound—larger values might work.

This macro is defined in all POSIX.2 systems, because POSIX.2 says it
should always be defined even if there is no specific imposed limit.
