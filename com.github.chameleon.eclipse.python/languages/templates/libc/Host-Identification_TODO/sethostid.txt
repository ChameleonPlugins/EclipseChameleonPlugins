The sethostid function sets the “host ID” of the host machine
to id.  Only privileged processes are permitted to do this.  Usually
it happens just once, at system boot time.

The proper way to establish the primary IP address of a system
is to configure the IP address resolver to associate that IP address with
the system’s host name as returned by gethostname.  For example,
put a record for the system in /etc/hosts.

See gethostid above for more information on host ids.

The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure.
The following errno error conditions are defined for this function:


EPERM
This process cannot set the host name because it is not privileged.


ENOSYS
The operating system does not support setting the host ID.  On some
systems, the host ID is a meaningless but unique number hard-coded for
each machine.
