This function returns the “host ID” of the machine the program is
running on.  By convention, this is usually the primary Internet IP address
of that machine, converted to a long int.  However, on some
systems it is a meaningless but unique number which is hard-coded for
each machine.

This is not widely used.  It arose in BSD 4.2, but was dropped in BSD 4.4.
It is not required by POSIX.

The proper way to query the IP address is to use gethostbyname
on the results of gethostname.  For more information on IP addresses,
See Host Addresses.
