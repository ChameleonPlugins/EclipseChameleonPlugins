The sethostname function sets the host name of the system that
calls it to name, a string with length length.  Only
privileged processes are permitted to do this.

Usually sethostname gets called just once, at system boot time.
Often, the program that calls it sets it to the value it finds in the
file /etc/hostname.


Be sure to set the host name to the full host name, not just the DNS
hostname (see above).

The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure.
The following errno error condition is defined for this function:


EPERM
This process cannot set the host name because it is not privileged.
