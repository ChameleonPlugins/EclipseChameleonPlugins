The environment is represented as an array of strings.  Each string is
of the format ‘name=value’.  The order in which
strings appear in the environment is not significant, but the same
name must not appear more than once.  The last element of the
array is a null pointer.

This variable is declared in the header file unistd.h.

If you just want to get the value of an environment variable, use
getenv.
